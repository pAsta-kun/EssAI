EssAI is a mini project that I wanted to work on in order to learn how to use a Vector Database along with an AI Chatbot to give the Chatbot some context to the question before it answers. 

EssAI is a chatbot to help High School students with their College Essays. It's been "trained" on 50~ reddit posts to help it be more accurate and provide relevent help.
