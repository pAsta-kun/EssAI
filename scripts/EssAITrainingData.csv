Essay,Analysis
"They covered the precious mahogany coffin with a brown amalgam of rocks, decomposed organisms, and weeds. It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life.When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing.I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter.  However, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow humans.   Volunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together.Cancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life. It’s easy to forget when one’s mind and body are so weak and vulnerable. I want to be there as an oncologist to remind them to take a walk once in a while, to remember that there’s so much more to life than a disease. While I physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the interruption and continue living. Through my work, I can accept the shovel without burying my grandmother’s memory.","Essay Critique:

Overall Score: 85/100

Strengths:
1. Emotional connection: This essay effectively conveys the emotion and personal connection the student has with their grandmother's death, and how it has shaped their perspective on life and education.
2. Clear focus: The essay effectively explores the student's journey from feeling guilt and resentment to finding purpose and meaning in their education and career aspirations.
3. Vivid imagery: The use of descriptive language and imagery throughout the essay adds depth and makes the narrative more engaging.

Areas of Concern:
1. Lack of structure: While the essay has a clear focus, there is a lack of structure, which makes it feel a bit disjointed. Consider organizing the essay into well-defined paragraphs or sections to enhance its readability.
2. Too many ideas: The essay jumps from the student's guilt to their commitment to education to volunteering at a cancer treatment center. While all these ideas are interesting, they should be developed more cohesively. Focus on one or two key ideas and expand on them.
3. Lack of specific examples: Provide specific examples to support your claims and experiences. For instance, when discussing your commitment to education, mention specific actions you took or experiences that reinforced this commitment.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the structure: Begin the essay with a clear introduction that sets the stage for the narrative. Then, dedicate a paragraph or two to each key idea or experience, making sure they flow logically from one to the next.
2. Consolidate ideas: Choose one or two key ideas that best highlight your journey and expand on those. Avoid introducing new ideas that distract from the main narrative. For example, focus on your commitment to education and how it evolved rather than introducing the volunteering experiences separately.
3. Provide specific examples: Add specific anecdotes or experiences that help convey the emotions and growth you experienced. This will add depth and make your essay more memorable.

Remember to show, not just tell, your experiences and emotions. Illustrate your commitment to education and your grandmother's memory through specific actions and reflections. Your essay has the potential to be a powerful personal statement, but it needs some refinement to reach its full potential. Good luck!"
"My laptop is like a passport. It is plastered with stickers all over the outside, inside, and bottom. Each sticker is a stamp, representing a place I've been, a passion I've pursued, or community I've belonged to. These stickers make for an untraditional first impression at a meeting or presentation, but it's one I'm proud of. Let me take you on a quick tour:""We < 3 Design,"" bottom left corner. Art has been a constant for me for as long as I can remember. Today my primary engagement with art is through design. I've spent entire weekends designing websites and social media graphics for my companies. Design means more to me than just branding and marketing; it gives me the opportunity to experiment with texture, perspective, and contrast, helping me refine my professional style.""Common Threads,"" bottom right corner. A rectangular black and red sticker displaying the theme of the 2017 TEDxYouth@Austin event. For years I've been interested in the street artists and musicians in downtown Austin who are so unapologetically themselves. As a result, I've become more open-minded and appreciative of unconventional lifestyles. TED gives me the opportunity to help other youth understand new perspectives, by exposing them to the diversity of Austin where culture is created, not just consumed.Poop emoji, middle right. My 13-year-old brother often sends his messages with the poop emoji 'echo effect,' so whenever I open a new message from him, hundreds of poops elegantly cascade across my screen. He brings out my goofy side, but also helps me think rationally when I am overwhelmed. We don't have the typical ""I hate you, don't talk to me"" siblinghood (although occasionally it would be nice to get away from him); we're each other's best friends. Or at least he's mine.""Lol ur not Harry Styles,"" upper left corner. Bought in seventh grade and transferred from my old laptop, this sticker is torn but persevering with layers of tape. Despite conveying my fangirl-y infatuation with Harry Styles' boyband, One Direction, for me Styles embodies an artist-activist who uses his privilege for the betterment of society. As a $42K donor to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, a hair donor to the Little Princess Trust, and promoter of LGBTQ+ equality, he has motivated me to be a more public activist instead of internalizing my beliefs.""Catapult,"" middle right. This is the logo of a startup incubator where I launched my first company, Threading Twine. I learned that business can provide others access to fundamental human needs, such as economic empowerment of minorities and education. In my career, I hope to be a corporate advocate for the empowerment of women, creating large-scale impact and deconstructing institutional boundaries that obstruct women from working in high-level positions. Working as a women's rights activist will allow me to engage in creating lasting movements for equality, rather than contributing to a cycle that elevates the stances of wealthy individuals.""Thank God it's Monday,"" sneakily nestled in the upper right corner. Although I attempt to love all my stickers equally (haha), this is one of my favorites. I always want my association with work to be positive.And there are many others, including the horizontal, yellow stripes of the Human Rights Campaign; ""The Team,"" a sticker from the Model G20 Economics Summit where I collaborated with youth from around the globe; and stickers from ""Kode with Klossy,"" a community of girls working to promote women's involvement in underrepresented fields.When my computer dies (hopefully not for another few years), it will be like my passport expiring. It'll be difficult leaving these moments and memories behind, but I probably won't want these stickers in my 20s anyways (except Harry Styles, that's never leaving). My next set of stickers will reveal my next set of aspirations. They hold the key to future paths I will navigate, knowledge I will gain, and connections I will make.","Essay Critique:

Overall Score: 74/100

Strengths:
1. Unique and creative metaphor: The essay starts with a strong and attention-grabbing metaphor comparing the laptop to a passport. This immediately engages the reader and sets a distinctive tone for the essay.
2. Insightful personal anecdotes: The essay includes several personal anecdotes that help to illustrate the student's passions and interests. These anecdotes add depth and authenticity to the essay.
3. Clear passion for design and activism: The student's passion for design and activism shines through in their descriptions of their involvement in various activities and communities. This passion is evident and helps to make the essay more compelling.

Areas of Concern:
1. Lack of structure and coherence: The essay jumps abruptly from one sticker to another without much connection or flow. The lack of a clear structure makes it difficult for the reader to follow the essay's narrative.
2. Lack of reflection and analysis: While the anecdotes provide valuable glimpses into the student's experiences, there is a lack of reflection and analysis. The essay would benefit from a deeper exploration of how these experiences have shaped the student and their future goals.
3. Limited focus on the college application: The essay is engaging and well-written, but it does not explicitly tie back to the student's college application or why they would be a strong candidate for admission. Including a section that directly addresses the student's academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and future aspirations would strengthen the overall essay.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Develop a clear structure: Create a roadmap for the essay that outlines which stickers and anecdotes will be discussed and in what order. This will help provide a clear and logical flow to the essay.
2. Reflect on experiences: After sharing each anecdote, take the time to reflect on its significance and how it has shaped the student's character, values, and aspirations. This self-reflection will add depth and insight to the essay.
3. Connect to college application: In a separate section, discuss the student's academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and future goals. Explicitly explain how these qualities make the student an ideal candidate for admission to the desired college.
4. Edit for conciseness: Some sections of the essay could be shortened or removed to maintain the reader's attention. Focus on the most impactful anecdotes and experiences, and make sure each paragraph adds value to the overall narrative.
5. Proofread for grammar and punctuation errors: The essay could benefit from a thorough proofreading to ensure correct grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. This will help to present a polished final product.

Remember, the goal of the essay is to showcase the student's strengths, passions, and potential as an applicant. By addressing the areas of concern and implementing the suggested improvements, the student can create a more cohesive and impactful personal statement."
"I am on Oxford Academy’s Speech and Debate Team, in both the Parliamentary Debate division and the Lincoln-Douglass debate division. I write screenplays, short stories, and opinionated blogs and am a regular contributor to my school literary magazine, The Gluestick. I have accumulated over 300 community service hours that includes work at homeless shelters, libraries, and special education youth camps. I have been evaluated by the College Board and have placed within the top percentile.But I am not any of these things. I am not a test score, nor a debater, nor a writer. I am an anti-nihilist punk rockphilosopher. And I became so when I realized three things:1) That the world is ruled by underwear. There is a variety of underwear for a variety of people. You have your ironed briefs for your businessmen, your soft cottons for the average, and hemp-based underwear for your environmental romantics. But underwear do not only tell us about who we are, they also influence our daily interactions in ways most of us don't even understand. For example, I have a specific pair of underwear that is holey, worn out but surprisingly comfortable. And despite how trivial underwear might be, when I am wearing my favorite pair, I feel as if I am on top of the world. In any case, these articles of clothing affect our being and are the unsung heroes of comfort.2) When I realized I cannot understand the world. I recently debated at the Orange County Speech League Tournament, within the Parliamentary Division. This specific branch of debate is an hour long, and consists of two parties debating either side of a current political issue. In one particular debate, I was assigned the topic: “Should Nation States eliminate nuclear arms?” It so happened that I was on the negative side and it was my job to convince the judges that countries should continue manufacturing nuclear weapons. During the debate, something strange happened: I realized that we are a special breed of species, that so much effort and resources are invested to ensure mutual destruction. And I felt that this debate in a small college classroom had elucidated something much more profound about the scale of human existence. In any case, I won 1st place at the tournament, but as the crowd cheered when my name was called to stand before an audience of hundreds of other debaters, and I flashed a victorious smile at the cameras, I couldn’t help but imagine that somewhere at that moment a nuclear bomb was being manufactured, adding to an ever-growing stockpile of doom. And that's when I realized that the world was something I will never understand.3) When I realized I was a punk rocker philosopher. One summer night, my friend took me to an underground hardcore punk rock show. It was inside a small abandoned church. After the show, I met and became a part of this small community. Many were lost and on a constant soul-search, and to my surprise, many, like myself, did not have a blue Mohawk or a nose piercing. Many were just ordinary people discussing Nietzsche, string theory, and governmental ideologies. Many were also artists creating promotional posters and inventive slogans for stickers. They were all people my age who could not afford to be part of a record label and did something extraordinary by playing in these abandoned churches, making their own CDs and making thousands of promotional buttons by hand. I realized then that punk rock is not about music nor is it a guy with a blue Mohawk screaming protests. Punk rock is an attitude, a mindset, and very much a culture. It is an antagonist to the conventional. It means making the best with what you have to contribute to a community. This was when I realized that I was a punk rock philosopher.The world I come from consists of underwear, nuclear bombs, and punk rockers. And I love this world. My world is inherently complex, mysterious, and anti-nihilist. I am David Phan, somebody who spends his weekends debating in a three piece suit, other days immersed within the punk rock culture, and some days writing opinionated blogs about underwear.But why college? I want a higher education. I want more than just the textbook fed classrooms in high school. A community which prizes revolutionary ideals, a sharing of multi-dynamical perspectives, an environment that ultimately acts as a medium for movement, similar to the punk rock community. I do not see college as a mere stepping stone for a stable career or a prosperous life, but as a supplement for knowledge and self-empowerment; it is a social engine that will jettison us to our next paradigm shift.","Overall, I would rate this essay a 65. While there are some strengths, there are several areas of concern that need to be addressed in order to make this essay more compelling and memorable.

One of the strengths of this essay is the author's ability to express their unique perspective and interests. They present themselves as an ""anti-nihilist punk rock philosopher"" and this helps to create a distinct and memorable identity. The author is also able to weave in personal anecdotes and experiences to support their ideas, such as their favorite pair of underwear and their experience at a punk rock show. These anecdotes help to add depth and authenticity to the essay.

However, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. Firstly, the essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps from topic to topic without a clear thread connecting them. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow the author's train of thought and understand the overall message of the essay. I would suggest organizing the essay into distinct paragraphs or sections, with each one focusing on a different aspect of the author's identity or values. This will help to create a more coherent and engaging narrative.

Additionally, the essay is lacking in specific details and concrete examples. While the author mentions being on the Speech and Debate Team, writing screenplays and blogs, and doing community service, they do not provide any specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate these experiences. Without specific details, these activities come across as vague and unimportant. I would suggest incorporating specific stories or examples to bring these activities to life and show the impact they have had on the author's life.

Furthermore, the tone of the essay is inconsistent. At times, the author uses informal and colloquial language, such as referring to underwear as the ""unsung heroes of comfort"" and describing themselves as a ""punk rock philosopher."" While these phrases help to convey the author's personality, they also undermine the overall seriousness and intellectual depth of the essay. I would recommend balancing the informal language with more formal and sophisticated language to demonstrate the author's maturity and intellectual ability.

Lastly, the essay lacks a strong conclusion. The author briefly mentions their desire for a higher education and their view of college as a supplement for knowledge and self-empowerment, but this is not fully developed or tied back to their earlier points about being a punk rock philosopher. I would suggest revisiting the conclusion and expanding on the author's motivations for attending college and how it aligns with their unique perspective and values.

In conclusion, this essay has potential but needs significant revision to improve its clarity, coherence, and impact. Addressing the issues of structure, specificity, tone, and conclusion will help to transform this essay into a compelling and memorable personal statement that will resonate with admissions officers. Good luck!"
"Every Saturday morning, I’d awaken to the smell of crushed garlic and piquant pepper. I would stumble into the kitchen to find my grandma squatting over a large silver bowl, mixing fat lips of fresh cabbages with garlic, salt, and red pepper. That was how the delectable Korean dish, kimchi, was born every weekend at my home.My grandma’s specialty always dominated the dinner table as kimchi filled every plate. And like my grandma who had always been living with us, it seemed as though the luscious smell of garlic would never leave our home. But even the prided recipe was defenseless against the ravages of Alzheimer’s that inflicted my grandma’s mind.Dementia slowly fed on her memories until she became as blank as a brand-new notebook. The ritualistic rigor of Saturday mornings came to a pause, and during dinner, the artificial taste of vacuum-packaged factory kimchi only emphasized the absence of the family tradition. I would look at her and ask, “Grandma, what’s my name?” But she would stare back at me with a clueless expression. Within a year of diagnosis, she lived with us like a total stranger.One day, my mom brought home fresh cabbages and red pepper sauce. She brought out the old silver bowl and poured out the cabbages, smothering them with garlic and salt and pepper. The familiar tangy smell tingled my nose. Gingerly, my grandma stood up from the couch in the living room, and as if lured by the smell, sat by the silver bowl and dug her hands into the spiced cabbages. As her bony hands shredded the green lips, a look of determination grew on her face. Though her withered hands no longer displayed the swiftness and precision they once did, her face showed the aged rigor of a professional. For the first time in years, the smell of garlic filled the air and the rattling of the silver bowl resonated throughout the house.That night, we ate kimchi. It wasn’t perfect; the cabbages were clumsily cut and the garlic was a little too strong. But kimchi had never tasted better. I still remember my grandma putting a piece in my mouth and saying, “Here, Dong Jin. Try it, my boy.”Seeing grandma again this summer, that moment of clarity seemed ephemeral. Her disheveled hair and expressionless face told of the aggressive development of her illness.But holding her hands, looking into her eyes, I could still smell that garlic. The moments of Saturday mornings remain ingrained in my mind. Grandma was an artist who painted the cabbages with strokes of red pepper. Like the sweet taste of kimchi, I hope to capture those memories in my keystrokes as I type away these words.A piece of writing is more than just a piece of writing. It evokes. It inspires. It captures what time takes away.My grandma used to say: “Tigers leave furs when they die, humans leave their names.” Her legacy was the smell of garlic that lingered around my house. Mine will be these words.","Essay Rating: 85

Strengths:
- The essay showcases a unique and personal story about the student's relationship with their grandmother and the impact of her Alzheimer's disease.
- The author effectively uses vivid and descriptive language to paint a picture of their Saturday morning tradition and the transformation that occurred.
- The use of sensory details, particularly the smell of garlic and kimchi, help to create a strong emotional connection for the reader.
- The essay demonstrates the student's reflection and introspection as they consider the importance of memories and their legacy.

Areas of Concern:
- The introduction of the essay could be stronger. While the opening sentence is attention-grabbing, it would benefit from a clearer statement of the essay's main theme or focus.
- The transitions between different sections could be smoother. Some connections between ideas feel abrupt or tangential, and would benefit from more clarity and cohesiveness.
- The essay could benefit from a more explicit connection to the student's future goals or aspirations. Currently, the focus remains largely on the past and the impact of their grandmother's illness.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the introduction to provide a clearer focus or thesis statement that sets up the rest of the essay. This will establish the purpose and direction right from the start.
2. Strengthen the transitions between different sections by using transitional phrases or sentences. Make sure each paragraph logically flows from one idea to the next, creating a cohesive narrative.
3. Consider expanding on the impact of the grandmother's illness on the student's own personal growth and development. How has this experience shaped their values, goals, or perspective? This will help create a stronger connection between the past and the present, and provide a sense of direction for the future.
4. Reflect on the broader significance of the grandmother's legacy beyond just the garlic smell. How does this experience relate to the student's own identity and the world around them? This will add depth and resonance to the essay's message.

Overall, this essay effectively conveys a personal story and leaves a lasting impression. With some refinements to the introduction, transitions, and connecting the story to the student's future aspirations, the essay has the potential to be even more impactful."
"When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.Interestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world.But the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin.I want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation.I think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.Today, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too.Click here for this student's amazing Instagram photos.","Essay Score: 80/100

Strengths:
- The introduction is engaging and captivating. The personal anecdote about visiting different countries and the use of descriptive language immediately hooks the reader's attention.
- The essay effectively demonstrates the student's passion for languages and their ability to connect with people from different cultures. The examples provided are unique and memorable.
- The conclusion connects back to the introduction by referencing the travel bug and highlights the student's addiction to language, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
- The essay showcases the student's ambition and future goals, emphasizing how their interest in foreign languages will be useful in various career paths.

Weaknesses:
- While the essay does a good job of describing the student's experiences and interests, it fails to provide a clear structure or organization. The ideas jump from one topic to another without a smooth transition, making it slightly confusing to follow.
- Some portions of the essay could benefit from more specific details to strengthen the narrative. For example, rather than briefly mentioning the interaction with the store owner in Paris, expanding on the experience and its impact would make it more impactful.
- The essay lacks a reflection on personal growth or lessons learned from these experiences. It would be beneficial for the writer to include some introspection about how their knowledge of languages and travels have shaped their worldview or influenced their identity.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Consider organizing the essay into distinct sections to create a stronger narrative flow. Start with an introduction that briefly highlights the student's love for travel, then move into separate paragraphs to describe experiences with each language studied (French, Spanish, and Chinese). Connect these with transitions that explain how each language discovery led to the next, and finally, conclude with a reflection on the overall impact of language learning.
2. Add more specific and vivid anecdotes or descriptions to each language learning experience. This will make the essay more personal and engaging for the reader.
3. Incorporate a reflection section at the end where the writer discusses how their experiences with language and travel have shaped their perspective and growth as an individual. This will add depth to the essay and make it more than just a list of experiences.
4. Consider discussing any challenges or failures faced while learning languages and how they were overcome. This will demonstrate growth and resilience.

Overall, this essay has a strong foundation with captivating descriptions and a clear passion for language learning. By working on its organization, adding more specific details, reflecting on personal growth, and discussing challenges faced, the essay will become a truly unforgettable and compelling narrative."
" Smeared blood, shredded feathers. Clearly, the bird was dead. But wait, the slight fluctuation of its chest, the slow blinking of its shiny black eyes. No, it was alive.I had been typing an English essay when I heard my cat's loud meows and the flutter of wings. I had turned slightly at the noise and had found the barely breathing bird in front of me.The shock came first. Mind racing, heart beating faster, blood draining from my face. I instinctively reached out my hand to hold it, like a long-lost keepsake from my youth. But then I remembered that birds had life, flesh, blood.Death. Dare I say it out loud? Here, in my own home?Within seconds, my reflexes kicked in. Get over the shock. Gloves, napkins, towels. Band-aid? How does one heal a bird? I rummaged through the house, keeping a wary eye on my cat. Donning yellow rubber gloves, I tentatively picked up the bird. Never mind the cat's hissing and protesting scratches, you need to save the bird. You need to ease its pain.But my mind was blank. I stroked the bird with a paper towel to clear away the blood, see the wound. The wings were crumpled, the feet mangled. A large gash extended close to its jugular rendering its breathing shallow, unsteady. The rising and falling of its small breast slowed. Was the bird dying? No, please, not yet. Why was this feeling so familiar, so tangible?Oh. Yes. The long drive, the green hills, the white church, the funeral. The Chinese mass, the resounding amens, the flower arrangements. Me, crying silently, huddled in the corner. The Hsieh family huddled around the casket. Apologies. So many apologies. Finally, the body  lowered to rest. The body. Kari Hsieh. Still familiar, still tangible.Hugging Mrs. Hsieh, I was a ghost, a statue. My brain and my body competed. Emotion wrestled with fact. Kari Hsieh, aged 17, my friend of four years, had died in the Chatsworth Metrolink Crash on Sep. 12, 2008. Kari was dead, I thought. Dead.But I could still save the bird.My frantic actions heightened my senses, mobilized my spirit. Cupping the bird, I ran outside, hoping the cool air outdoors would suture every wound, cause the bird to miraculously fly away. Yet there lay the bird in my hands, still gasping, still dying. Bird, human, human, bird. What was the difference? Both were the same. Mortal.But couldn't I do something? Hold the bird longer, de-claw the cat? I wanted to go to my bedroom, confine myself to tears, replay my memories, never come out. The bird's warmth faded away. Its heartbeat slowed along with its breath. For a long time, I stared thoughtlessly at it, so still in my hands.Slowly, I dug a small hole in the black earth. As it disappeared under handfuls of dirt, my own heart grew stronger, my own breath more steady.The wind, the sky, the dampness of the soil on my hands whispered to me, “The bird is dead. Kari has passed. But you are alive.” My breath, my heartbeat, my sweat sighed back, “I am alive. I am alive. I am alive.”","Essay Critique:

Overall Score: 78/100

Strengths:
- The essay starts with a vivid and attention-grabbing opening that immediately draws the reader in.
- The use of descriptive language and imagery throughout the essay helps to create a strong sense of atmosphere and emotion.
- The connection made between the bird and the narrator's personal experience with death is interesting and adds depth to the storytelling.

Weaknesses:
- The essay lacks a clear central theme or message. It jumps from describing the bird and its injuries to recounting the narrator's experience with death.
- The transition between the bird incident and the personal experience with death could be smoother and more cohesive. It feels a bit disjointed.
- The essay could benefit from more reflection and introspection. The narrator's thoughts and feelings are mentioned, but not explored in depth.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Have a clear central theme: Decide on a central theme or message that you want to convey through your essay. This will help give your essay a sense of purpose and direction. Some possible themes could include resilience, the circle of life, or the fragility of existence. 

2. Connect the two parts of the essay: Find ways to better connect the initial incident with the bird and the narrator's personal experience with death. You could explore how the bird's struggle to survive mirrors the narrator's own struggle to come to terms with death. This will create a stronger narrative arc and make the essay more cohesive.

3. Reflect on your feelings and growth: Instead of just describing events, take the time to explore your thoughts and feelings in more depth. Consider how the experience with the bird and witnessing death has impacted you and what you have learned from it. Reflecting on your growth and resilience will make your essay more personal and meaningful.

4. Provide a conclusion: The essay ends abruptly and could benefit from a more conclusive ending. Consider wrapping up the essay by tying back to the central theme and reflecting on how the experience with the bird and death has shaped your outlook on life.

Overall, this essay has potential but needs some refining to become a more cohesive and impactful personal statement. Keep revising and focusing on the central theme to strengthen your essay and make it truly memorable."
"From page 54 of the maroon notebook sitting on my mahogany desk:“Then Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.” - Genesis 4:13Here is a secret that no one in my family knows: I shot my brother when I was six. Luckily, it was a BB gun. But to this day, my older brother Jonathan does not know who shot him. And I have finally promised myself to confess this eleven year old secret to him after I write this essay.The truth is, I was always jealous of my brother. Our grandparents, with whom we lived as children in Daegu, a rural city in South Korea, showered my brother with endless accolades: he was bright, athletic, and charismatic.“Why can’t you be more like Jon?” my grandmother used to nag, pointing at me with a carrot stick. To me, Jon was just cocky. He would scoff at me when he would beat me in basketball, and when he brought home his painting of Bambi with the teacher’s sticker “Awesome!” on top, he would make several copies of it and showcase them on the refrigerator door. But I retreated to my desk where a pile of “Please draw this again and bring it to me tomorrow” papers lay, desperate for immediate treatment. Later, I even refused to attend the same elementary school and wouldn’t even eat meals with him.Deep down I knew I had to get the chip off my shoulder. But I didn’t know how.That is, until March 11th, 2001.That day around six o’clock, juvenile combatants appeared in Kyung Mountain for their weekly battle, with cheeks smeared in mud and empty BB guns in their hands. The Korean War game was simple: to kill your opponent you had to shout “pow!” before he did. Once we situated ourselves, our captain blew the pinkie whistle and the war began. My friend Min-young and I hid behind a willow tree, eagerly awaiting our orders.Beside us, our comrades were dying, each falling to the ground crying in “agony,” their hands clasping their “wounds.” Suddenly a wish for heroism surged within me: I grabbed Min-young’s arms and rushed towards the enemies’ headquarters, disobeying our orders to remain sentry duty. To tip the tide of the war, I had to kill their captain. We infiltrated the enemy lines, narrowly dodging each attack. We then cleared the pillars of asparagus ferns until the Captain’s lair came into view. I quickly pulled my clueless friend back into the bush.Hearing us, the alarmed captain turned around: It was my brother.He saw Min-young’s right arm sticking out from the bush and hurled a “grenade,” (a rock), bruising his arm.“That’s not fair!” I roared in the loudest and most unrecognizable voice I could manage.Startled, the Captain and his generals abandoned their post. Vengeance replaced my wish for heroism and I took off after the fleeing perpetrator. Streams of sweat ran down my face and I pursued him for several minutes until suddenly I was arrested by a small, yellow sign that read in Korean: DO NOT TRESPASS: Boar Traps Ahead. (Two summers ago, my five year old cousin, who insisted on joining the ranks, had wandered off-course during the battle; we found him at the bottom of a 20 ft deep pit with a deep gash in his forehead and shirt soaked in blood) “Hey, stop!” I shouted, heart pounding. “STOP!” My mind froze. My eyes just gazed at the fleeing object; what should I do?I looked on as my shivering hand reached for the canister of BBs. The next second, I heard two shots followed by a cry. I opened my eyes just enough to see two village men carrying my brother away from the warning sign. I turned around, hurled my BB gun into the nearby Kyung Creek and ran home as fast as I could.* * *Days passed. My brother and I did not talk about the incident.‘Maybe he knew it was me,’ I thought in fear as I tried to eavesdrop on his conversation with grandpa one day. When the door suddenly opened, I blurted, “Is anything wrong?”“Nothing,” he said pushing past me, “Just a rough sleep.”But in the next few weeks, something was happening inside me.All the jealousy and anger I’d once felt had been replaced by a new feeling: guilt.That night when my brother was gone I went to a local store and bought a piece of chocolate taffy, his favorite. I returned home and placed it on my brother’s bed with a note attached: “Love, Grandma.”Several days later, I secretly went into his room and folded his unkempt pajamas.Then, other things began to change. We began sharing clothes (something we had never done), started watching Pokémon episodes together, and then, on his ninth birthday, I did something with Jon that I hadn’t done in six years: I ate dinner with him. I even ate fishcakes, which he loved but I hated. And I didn’t complain.Today, my brother is one of my closest friends. Every week I accompany him to Carlson Hospital where he receives treatment for his obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. While in the waiting room, we play a noisy game of Zenga, comment on the Lakers’ performance or listen to the radio on the registrar’s desk.Then, the door to the doctor’s office opens.“Jonathan Lee, please come in.”I tap his shoulder and whisper, “Rock it, bro.”After he leaves, I take out my notebook and begin writing where I left off.Beside me, the receptionist’s fingers hover over the radio in search of a new station, eventually settling on one. I hear LeAnn Rimes singing “Amazing Grace.” Her voice slowly rises over the noise of the bustling room.“’Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear. And Grace, my fears relieved...”Smiling, I open Jon’s Jansport backpack and neatly place this essay inside and a chocolate taffy with a note attached.Twenty minutes have passed when the door abruptly opens.“Guess what the doctor just said?” my brother cries, unable to hide his exhilaration.I look up and I smile too.For analysis of what makes this essay amazing, go here.","Overall, I would rate this essay a 90. It is a powerful, personal narrative that captures the reader's attention from the very beginning. The writer's use of a biblical quote and the confession of shooting their brother creates intrigue and sets the stage for a compelling story.

One of the strengths of this essay is the use of descriptive language. The writer vividly describes the setting and the events, which allows the reader to visualize the story. For example, when describing the Korean War game, the author paints a picture of mud-soaked cheeks and empty BB guns, creating a sense of excitement and adventure.

Another strength is the writer's ability to convey a range of emotions. The essay explores feelings of jealousy, anger, guilt, and eventually, remorse. These emotions are conveyed effectively through the author's personal reflections and actions, such as buying their brother's favorite candy and folding his pajamas.

The essay also incorporates a clear theme of personal growth and transformation. The writer starts off as a jealous and resentful sibling, but through a series of events, they learn to let go of their negative feelings and develop a strong bond with their brother. This theme is reinforced through the use of specific details and anecdotes, such as sharing clothes and eating dinner together.

However, there are a few areas of concern. The essay could benefit from a stronger introduction and conclusion. The first few sentences are attention-grabbing, but the rest of the introduction feels a bit disjointed. A more clear thesis or main idea could help orient the reader and provide a framework for the rest of the essay. Similarly, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could be expanded upon to provide a sense of closure.

Additionally, while the essay is engaging, there are moments where the writing could be more concise. Some sentences are overly long and contain unnecessary details, which can make the essay feel drawn out. Streamlining the writing and focusing on the most impactful details would help maintain the reader's attention throughout.

In terms of improvement, the writer could consider adding more reflection and analysis. While the essay does a good job of describing the events, there could be more exploration of the writer's thoughts and feelings during each stage of the story. This would help the essay feel more introspective and add depth to the narrative.

In conclusion, this essay is a strong personal statement that effectively captures the reader's attention and conveys a powerful message of personal growth. With some minor adjustments to the introduction, conclusion, and writing style, this essay has the potential to be truly exceptional."
"Bowing down to the porcelain god, I emptied the contents of my stomach. Foaming at the mouth, I was ready to pass out. My body couldn’t stop shaking as I gasped for air, and the room started spinning.Ten minutes prior, I had been eating dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, drinking chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in it, because when I was two we found out that I am deathly allergic to them. When the waitress replied no, I went for it. Suddenly I started scratching my neck, feeling the hives that had started to form. I rushed to the restroom to throw up because my throat was itchy and I felt a weight on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, which prevented me from taking anything but shallow breaths. I was fighting the one thing that is meant to protect me and keep me alive – my own body.At five years old, I couldn’t comprehend what had happened. All I knew was that I felt sick, and I was waiting for my mom to give me something to make it better. I thought my parents were superheroes; surely they would be able to make well again. But I became scared when I heard the fear in their voices as they rushed me to the ER.After that incident, I began to fear. I became scared of death, eating, and even my own body. As I grew older, I became paranoid about checking food labels and I avoided eating if I didn’t know what was in the food. I knew what could happen if I ate one wrong thing, and I wasn’t willing to risk it for a snack. Ultimately, that fear turned into resentment; I resented my body for making me an outsider.In the years that followed, this experience and my regular visits to my allergy specialist inspired me to become an allergy specialist. Even though I was probably only ten at the time, I wanted to find a way to help kids like me. I wanted to find a solution so that nobody would have to feel the way I did; nobody deserved to feel that pain, fear, and resentment. As I learned more about the medical world, I became more fascinated with the body’s immune responses, specifically, how a body reacts to allergens. This past summer, I took a month-long course on human immunology at Stanford University. I learned about the different mechanisms and cells that our bodies use in order to fight off pathogens. My desire to major in biology in college has been stimulated by my fascination with the human body, its processes, and the desire to find a way to help people with allergies. I hope that one day I can find a way to stop allergic reactions or at least lessen the symptoms, so that children and adults don’t have to feel the same fear and bitterness that I felt.","Overall, this personal statement provides a compelling narrative of the student's personal experience with a severe allergic reaction and how it has shaped their career aspirations. The opening scene is vividly described, drawing the reader in and creating a sense of immediacy. The essay effectively conveys the fear, pain, and resentment that the student felt as a result of their allergy, as well as their determination to find a solution to help others.

One of the strengths of this essay is the clear and concise writing style. The student effectively communicates their thoughts and emotions without unnecessary embellishment. The use of specific details, such as the mention of chicken-feet soup, adds authenticity to the story and helps the reader to visualize the situation.

The essay also demonstrates the student's passion for biology and immunology. The reference to their summer course at Stanford University shows the initiative and dedication they have towards pursuing their academic interests. This passion adds depth to their personal statement and provides a clear explanation for their chosen major.

However, there are a few areas of concern in this essay. First, there is a lack of reflection on the student's personal growth and development. While it is clear that the allergic reaction had a profound impact on their life, the essay would benefit from additional introspection. For example, the student could discuss how they have learned to cope with their allergy or how they have grown in their understanding and acceptance of their own body. This would add depth to their narrative and show personal growth.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from a more explicit connection between the student's personal experience and their desired career as an allergy specialist. The essay briefly mentions regular visits to an allergy specialist, but does not delve into how these experiences have influenced their career goals in a meaningful way. Providing concrete examples or specific experiences that have shaped their interest in becoming an allergy specialist would strengthen their argument.

In terms of improvement, the essay could benefit from a stronger conclusion. The last paragraph abruptly transitions to the student's desire to major in biology and find a solution for allergies. A more nuanced conclusion would tie together the main themes of the essay and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Overall, I would rate this essay a 70 out of 100. It effectively conveys the student's personal experience and passion for their chosen field, but could benefit from further reflection and a stronger conclusion. With some revision and additional development, this essay has the potential to become a standout component of their college application."
"When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Watkins was the coordinator of the foreign exchange student program I was enrolled in. She had a nine year old son named Cody. I would babysit Cody every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me from Charlotte’s Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him and ask him the meanings of certain words. He was my first friend in the New World.My second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of the Watkins’s. The host dad Michael was a high school English teacher and the host mom Jennifer (who had me call her “Jen”) taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. The Martinez family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days, Michael, Jen and I would sit on the porch and listen to the rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad.After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. I wanted to see new places and meet different people. Since I wasn’t an exchange student anymore, I had the freedom--and burden--of finding a new school and host family on my own. After a few days of thorough investigation, I found the Struiksma family in California. They were a unique group.The host mom Shellie was a single mom who had two of her own sons and two Russian daughters that she had adopted. The kids always had something warm to eat, and were always on their best behavior at home and in school. It would be fair to say that this was all due to Shellie’s upbringing. My room was on the first floor, right in front of Shellie’s hair salon, a small business that she ran out of her home. In the living room were six or seven huge amplifiers and a gigantic chandelier hung from the high ceiling. The kitchen had a bar. At first, the non-stop visits from strangers made me nervous, but soon I got used to them. I remember one night, a couple barged into my room while I was sleeping. It was awkward.After a few months I realized we weren’t the best fit. In the nicest way possible, I told them I had to leave. They understood.The Ortiz family was my fourth family. Kimberly, the host mom, treated me the same way she treated her own son. She made me do chores: I fixed dinner, fed their two dogs Sassy and Lady, and once a week I cleaned the bathroom. I also had to follow some rules: No food in my room, no using the family computer, no lights on after midnight, and no ride unless it was an emergency. The first couple of months were really hard to get used to, but eventually I adjusted.I lived with the Ortiz family for seven months like a monk in the deep forest. However, the host dad Greg’s asthma got worse after winter, so he wanted to move to the countryside. It was unexpected and I only had a week to find a new host family. I asked my friend Danielle if I could live with her until I found a new home. That’s how I met the Dirksen family, my fifth family.The Dirksen family had three kids. They were all different. Danielle liked bitter black coffee, Christian liked energy drinks, and Becca liked sweet lemon tea. Dawn, the host mom didn’t like winter, and Mark, the host dad, didn’t like summer. After dinner, we would all play Wii Sports together. I was the king of bowling, and Dawn was the queen of tennis. I don’t remember a single time that they argued about the games. Afterward, we would gather in the living room and Danielle would play the piano while the rest of us sang hymns.Of course, those 28 months were too short to fully understand all five families, but I learned from and was shaped by each of them. By teaching me English, nine year-old Cody taught me the importance of being able to learn from anyone; the Martinez family showed me the value of spending time together as a family; the Struiksma family taught me to reserve judgment about divorced women and adopted children; Mrs. Ortiz taught me the value of discipline and the Dirksen family taught me the importance of appreciating one another’s different qualities.Getting along with other people is necessary for anyone and living with five families has made me more sensitive to others’ needs: I have learned how to recognize when someone needs to talk, when I should give advice and when to simply listen, and when someone needs to be left alone; in the process, I have become much more adaptable. I’m ready to change, learn, and be shaped by my future families.","Essay Critique:

"I’ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic.  For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. My transformation began with my mom’s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole “vegan” thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as “What the Health” and “Forks Over Knives”. We read all the books by the featured doctors like “The China Study” and “How Not To Die”. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. Each new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? Food has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn’t I also want to nourish the earth? My journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, “Biggest Little Plant Pod”, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn’t the sexiest superfood out there, so here’s my sales pitch: I’m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. Finally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don’t helps me educate, as I’ve found that information tends to stick in a person’s mind once they’ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body.While my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team’s Most Improved award. I’m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic.","Essay Critique:

"Meditation over a flaxen sunset with a friend and parmesan-topped spaghetti for dinner — “14.” Assignments piling up on my desk as a high fever keeps me sick at home — “3.” Taking a photo excursion through downtown Seattle for a Spanish project — “15.” For the past 700 days and counting, the Happiness Spreadsheet has been my digital collection for documenting numerical, descriptive, and graphical representations of my happiness. Its instructions are simple: Open the Google Sheet, enter a number between 1 and 20 that best represents my level of happiness, and write a short comment describing the day. But the practical aspect of the spreadsheet is only a piece of what it has represented in my life.A “14” etched on November 15, 2018, marked the first Lakeside Cooking on the Stove Club meeting. What had started as a farcical proposition of mine transformed into a playground where high school classmates and I convene every two weeks to prepare a savory afternoon snack for ourselves. A few months later, a “16” scribbled on February 27, 2019, marked the completion of a fence my Spanish class and I constructed for the dusty soccer field at a small Colombian village. Hard-fought days of mixing cement and transporting supplies had paid off for the affectionate community we had immediately come to love. The Happiness Spreadsheet doesn’t only reflect my own thoughts and emotions; it is an illustration of the fulfillment I get from gifting happiness to others.If happiness paves the roads of my life, my family is the city intertwined by those roads — each member a distinct neighborhood, a distinct story. In times of stress, whether it be studying for an upcoming derivatives test or presenting my research at an international conference, I dash to my father for help. Coming from the dusty, people-packed backstreets of Thiruvananthapuram, India, he guides me in looking past the chaos and noticing the hidden accomplishments that lie in the corners. When in need of confidence, I find my mother, who taps her experiences living in her tranquil and sturdy tatami-covered home in Hiroshima, Japan, helping me prepare for my first high school dance or my final match in a tennis tournament. Whenever my Happiness Spreadsheet numbers touch lows, my family is always there to level me out to “10.”The Happiness Spreadsheet is also a battery monitor for enthusiasm. On occasion, it is on full charge, like when I touched the last chord on the piano for my composition's winner recital or when, one frosty Friday morning, I convinced a teacher to play over the school speakers a holiday medley I’d recorded with a friend. Other times, the battery is depleted, and I am frustrated by writer's block, when not a single melody, chord, or musical construct crosses my mind. The Happiness Spreadsheet can be a hall of fame, but it can likewise be a catalog of mistakes, burdens, and grueling challenges.The spreadsheet began on a typical school day when I left my physics class following the most confusing test I’d taken. The idea was born spontaneously at lunch, and I asked two of my friends if they were interested in pursuing this exercise with me. We thought the practice would last only a couple of weeks or months at most, but after reaching 700 days, we now wonder if we’ll ever stop. To this day, I ponder its full importance in my life. With every new number I enter, I recognize that each entry is not what defines me; rather, it is the ever-growing line connecting all the data points that reflects who I am today. With every valley, I force myself onward and with every mountain's peak, I recognize the valleys I’ve crossed to reach the summit. Where will the Happiness Spreadsheet take me next?","Overall score: 78/100

Strengths:
- The essay effectively introduces the concept of the Happiness Spreadsheet and its significance in the writer's life. The initial anecdotes provide concrete examples to illustrate its impact.
- The inclusion of personal stories and experiences, such as the Lakeside Cooking on the Stove Club and the construction of a fence in a Colombian village, adds depth and showcases the writer's engagement in meaningful activities.
- The connection between the Happiness Spreadsheet and the writer's family is well-established, highlighting the importance of familial support and the role they play in the writer's happiness.
- The use of the metaphor of a battery monitor for enthusiasm is engaging and creative, capturing both the highs and lows of the writer's experiences.
- The essay ends with a sense of curiosity and anticipation, leaving the reader wondering about the future and what the Happiness Spreadsheet will bring.

Weaknesses:
- The essay lacks a clear structure. It jumps from one anecdote to another without a smooth transition or guiding thread. Consider organizing the essay into distinct sections that focus on different aspects of the Happiness Spreadsheet or the writer's experiences.
- The connection between the Happiness Spreadsheet and the writer's personal growth or development is not fully explored. While the essay briefly mentions reflection and growth, it would benefit from expanding on how the Happiness Spreadsheet has contributed to the author's personal and emotional growth.
- The writing style is sometimes overly descriptive and repetitive, which can detract from the overall impact of the essay. Streamline the language and focus on conveying the writer's emotions and experiences concisely.
- More specific examples and anecdotes from the Happiness Spreadsheet could be included to further illustrate its impact. This would add depth and variety to the examples presented.
- The essay lacks a strong conclusion. Consider reinforcing the main themes or summarizing the journey with the Happiness Spreadsheet to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Provide a clear structure for the essay by organizing it into sections that focus on different aspects of the writer's experiences with the Happiness Spreadsheet.
- Further explore and reflect on the personal growth and development that the Happiness Spreadsheet has facilitated. Connect it to specific moments or examples in the writer's life.
- Revise and edit the essay for conciseness and clarity. Remove repetitive language and focus on impactful storytelling.
- Include more specific examples and anecdotes from the Happiness Spreadsheet to enhance the reader's understanding of its significance.
- Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the essay's main themes and leaving the reader with a poignant final thought about the writer's journey with the Happiness Spreadsheet."
""".miK ijniM"" This is how I wrote my name until I was seven. I was a left-handed kid who wrote from right to left, which made my writing comprehensible only to myself. Only after years of practice did I become an ambidextrous writer who could translate my incomprehensible writing. As I look back on my life, I realized that this was my first act of translation. Translation means reinterpreting my Calculus teacher’s description of L’hospital’s rule into a useful tool for solving the limits. As I deciphered complex codes into comprehensible languages like rate of change and speed of an object, I gained the ability to solve even more complicated and fascinating problems. My Calculus teacher often told me, “It’s not until you can teach math concepts to somebody that you understand them completely.” Before I discovered the joy of teaching, I often explained difficult math concepts to my friends as a tool for reviewing what I’d learned. Now, I volunteer to tutor others: as a Korean tutor for friends who love Korean culture and a golf tutor for new team members. Tutoring is how I integrate and strengthen new concepts for myself.  My talent for translating also applies to my role as a “therapist” for my family and friends. I’m able to identify their real feelings beneath superficial words by translating hand-gestures, facial expressions, and tones. I often put myself into their situation and ask, ""What emotional support would I want or need if I was in this situation?"" Through these acts of translation, I’ve grown into a more reliable and perceptive friend, daughter, and sister. However, my translation can't accurately account for the experiences I have yet to go through. After realizing the limitations of my experience, I created a bucket list full of activities out of my comfort zone, which includes traveling abroad by myself, publishing my own book, and giving a lecture in front of a crowd. Although it is a mere list written on the front page of my diary, I found myself vividly planning and picturing myself accomplishing those moments. By widening my experiences, I’ll be a therapist who can empathize fully and give meaningful advice based on rich experiences.My knack for translating has led me to become a real-life Korean language translator. As an English to Korean letter translator in a non-profit organization, Compassion, I serve as a communication bridge between benefactors and children in developing countries, who communicate through monthly letters. I’ve translated hundreds of letters by researching each country to provide context that considers both cultural aspects and nuances of the language. This experience has motivated me to learn languages like Spanish and Mandarin. I’ve realized that learning various languages has been a journey of self-discovery: the way I talk and interact with people changed depending on the language I used. As I get to know more about myself through different languages, I grew more confident to meet new people and build new friendships.While translating has been a huge part of my life, a professional translator is not my dream job. I want to be an ambulatory care clinical pharmacist who manages the medication of patients with chronic diseases. In fact, translating is a huge part of the job of a clinical pharmacist. I should substitute myself into patients’ situations to respond to their needs effectively, which requires my translating skill as a “therapist.” Moreover, as a clinical pharmacist, I’ll be the patients’ private tutor who not only guides them through the right use of medication but also gives them emotional support. As my qualities as a “therapist” and a “tutor” shaped me into a great translator, I will continue to develop my future as a clinical pharmacist by enhancing and discovering my qualities. In one form or another, I've always been and will be a translator.","Essay Score: 78

"I sit, cradled by the two largest branches of the Newton Pippin Tree, watching the ether. The Green Mountains of Vermont stretch out indefinitely, and from my elevated vantage point, I feel as though we are peers, motionless in solidarity. I’ve lost my corporeal form and instead, while watching invisible currents drive white leviathans across the sky, have drifted up into the epistemological stream; completely alone with my questions, diving for answers. But a few months ago, I would have considered this an utter waste of time. Prior to attending Mountain School, my paradigm was substantially limited; opinions, prejudices, and ideas shaped by the testosterone-rich environment of Landon School. I was herded by result-oriented, fast-paced, technologically-reliant parameters towards psychology and neuroscience (the NIH, a mere 2.11 mile run from my school, is like a beacon on a hill). I was taught that one’s paramount accomplishment should be specialization. Subconsciously I knew this was not who I wanted to be and seized the chance to apply to the Mountain School. Upon my arrival, though, I immediately felt I did not belong. I found the general atmosphere of hunky-dory acceptance foreign and incredibly unnerving. So, rather than engage, I retreated to what was most comfortable: sports and work. In the second week, the perfect aggregate of the two, a Broomball tournament, was set to occur. Though I had never played before, I had a distinct vision for it, so decided to organize it.That night, the glow-in-the-dark ball skittered across the ice. My opponent and I, brooms in hand, charged forward. We collided and I banana-peeled, my head taking the brunt of the impact. Stubborn as I was, even with a concussion, I wanted to remain in class and do everything my peers did, but my healing brain protested. My teachers didn’t quite know what to do with me, so, no longer confined to a classroom if I didn’t want to be, I was in limbo. I began wandering around campus with no company except my thoughts. Occasionally, Zora, my English teacher’s dog, would tag along and we’d walk for miles in each other's silent company. Other times, I found myself pruning the orchard, feeding the school’s wood furnaces, or my new favorite activity, splitting wood. Throughout those days, I created a new-found sense of home in my head.However, thinking on my own wasn’t enough; I needed more perspectives. I organized raucous late-night discussions about everything from medieval war machines to political theory and  randomly challenged my friends to “say something outrageous and defend it.” And whether we achieve profundity or not, I find myself enjoying the act of discourse itself. As Thoreau writes, “Let the daily tide leave some deposit on these pages, as it leaves, the waves may cast up pearls.” I have always loved ideas, but now understand what it means to ride their waves, to let them breathe and become something other than just answers to immediate problems. I am most enamored by ideas that cultivate ingenious and practical enrichments for humanity. I enjoy picking some conundrum, large or small, and puzzling out a solution. Returning from a cross country meet recently, my friend and I, serendipitously, designed a socially responsible disposable water bottle completely on accident. Now we hope to create it.I am still interested in psychology and neuroscience, but also desire to incorporate contemplative thought into this work, analyzing enigmas from many different perspectives. My internships at the NIH and the National Hospital for Neuroscience and Neurosurgery in London have offered me valuable exposure to research and medicine. But I have come to realize that neither of my previous intended professions allow me to expand consciousness in the way I would prefer. After much soul-searching, I have landed on behavioral economics as the perfect synergy of the fields I love. All it took was a knock on the head.","Overall, this essay presents a compelling narrative of the student's personal growth and intellectual exploration. The opening paragraph effectively captures the reader's attention with vivid imagery and a sense of introspection. The writer's ability to convey their experience at Mountain School and their struggle to find their place is commendable.

Strengths:
- Engaging opening paragraph hooks the reader.
- The essay effectively conveys the writer's journey towards self-discovery and their desire to explore different perspectives.
- The writer demonstrates a passion for ideas and intellectual discourse.
- The inclusion of personal anecdotes, such as the Broomball incident and late-night discussions, adds depth and authenticity to the essay.
- The writer's ability to connect their experiences to their career aspirations shows thoughtful consideration of their future path.

Areas of concern:
- The essay could benefit from clearer organization and transitions between ideas. While the narrative flow is generally coherent, there are instances where the reader may feel a bit disoriented.
- The discussion of the writer's internships feels somewhat disjointed and could be better integrated into the overall narrative.
- The conclusion is a bit abrupt and could benefit from a stronger sense of closure or reflection.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Work on improving the overall structure and organization of the essay. Consider using transition sentences or paragraphs to guide the reader through the writer's journey more seamlessly.
2. Connect the discussion of the internships more explicitly to the writer's personal growth and exploration. How did these experiences contribute to their understanding of themselves and their future aspirations?
3. Consider adding a concluding paragraph that reflects on the writer's journey and ties together the different threads of the essay. This could provide a sense of closure and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Rating: 87/100
This essay effectively conveys the writer's personal growth and intellectual exploration, but could benefit from improvements in organization and the inclusion of a stronger conclusion. Overall, a strong piece with a compelling narrative."
"“Chris, what would you like to have for Christmas Dinner?”Suddenly, a miniature gathering of the European Commission glares straight at me. I feel the pressure of picking one option over the other. What do I choose? The Roast Duck of Denmark, the Five Fish of Italy, the Turkey of Great Britain, or the Ham of the U.S.? Like the various nations of the European Union, the individual proponents of these culinary varieties are lobbying their interests to me, a miniature Jean-Claude Junker.Now, you may be asking yourselves: why would I be so pensive over a meal choice?See, I have been blessed to be a part of what my mother calls the “melting pot of Europe.”  While I was born in England, my brothers were born in Denmark and New York. I have a Swedish sister-in-law, Italian Aunts, an English Uncle, Romanian cousins and an Italo-Danish immigrant father. Every year, that same family gathers together in New York City to celebrate Christmas. While this wonderful kaleidoscope of cultures has caused me to be the ‘peacekeeper’ during meal arbitrations, it has fundamentally impacted my life.  Our family’s ethnic diversity has meant that virtually each person adheres to a different position on the political spectrum. This has naturally triggered many discussions, ranging from the merits of European single-payer healthcare to those of America’s gun laws, that have often animated our meals. These exact conversations drove me to learn more about what my parents, grandparents, and other relatives were debating with a polite and considerate passion. This ongoing discourse on current events not only initiated my interests in politics and history, but also prepared me greatly for my time as a state-champion debater for Regis’s Public Forum team. In turn, participating in debate has expanded my knowledge regarding matters ranging from civil rights reparations to American redeployment in Iraq, while enriching my capacities to thoughtfully express my views on those and other issues, both during P.F. rounds and at the dinner table.Just as I’ve learned to understand and bridge the divides between a rich tapestry of cultures in order to develop my familial relations, society’s leadership must also do the same on a grander scale. This awareness incited a passion for statecraft within me – the very art of balancing different perspectives - and therefore a desire to actively engage in government. With my experiences in mind, I felt there was no better place to start than my own neighborhood of Bay Ridge. Young hipsters, a high concentration of seniors, Italian & Irish middle class families, and a growing population of Middle-Eastern Americans help to comprise a district that I have begun serving as the first teenaged member of my local Community Board.  Within my public service capacity, I am committed to making policy judgments (for example, regarding hookah bars, zoning regulations, and park renovation expenses) that are both wise and respectful of my community’s diversity. Most importantly, my family has taught me an integral life lesson. As our Christmas Dinner squabbles suggest, seemingly insurmountable impasses can be resolved through respect and dialogue, even producing delicious results! On a grander scale, it has elucidated that truly inclusive discourse and toleration of diverse perspectives render tribalism, sectarianism, and the  divisive aspects of identity politics powerless over our cohesion. I fundamentally value cultural, political, and theological variety; my own microcosm reflecting our global society at large has inspired me to strive to solve the many conflicts of bitterness and sectionalism in our world today. This vocation may come in the form of political leadership that truly respects all perspectives and philosophies, or perhaps as diplomacy facilitating unity between the various nations of the world. The problems I would need to help remedy are numerous and daunting, but our annual Christmas feasts will forever remind me that they can be overcome, and that humanity’s diversity is not a weakness, but a definitive strength.","Essay Rating: 85

"Before I came to America, I drank Puer Tea with my father every morning in my bedroom, sitting cross-legged on Suzhou-silk mats beside a view of the Lakeside reservoir. Beside a dark end table, we picked up teacups as the mild aroma greeted our noses. As we faced the French window, my father would share the news he read in China Daily: the Syrian civil war, climate change, and gender equality in Hollywood. Most of the time, I only listened. With each piece of news, my curiosity piqued. Secretly, I made a decision that I wanted to be the one to discuss the news with him from my perspective. So, I decided to study in America to learn more about the world.   After one year’s extensive research and hours of interviews, I came to America for 9th grade and moved in with a host family. But, my new room lacked stories and cups of tea. Fortunately, I found Blue House Cafe on my walk home from church, and started studying there. With white walls, comfortable sofas, and high stools, Blue House is spacious and bright. Hearing people’s stories and looking at their warm smiles when they taste various pastries as I sat by the window, I watched as a production designer scouted locations for his film, or a painter took notes while brainstorming for his freehand brushwork of Blue House. With a cup of coffee, I dig into differential and parametric equations for my upcoming AP Calculus test, learn the nuances of public speaking by watching Michael Sandel’s Justice lectures on my laptop, and plan fundraising events for my non-profit. I’ve also learned by watching leaders host meetings at the rectangle conference table at the back of the cafe and I learn from the leaders of meetings, watching as they hold the edge of the table and express their ideas. Similarly, as president of the International Students Club, I invited my teammates to have meetings with me at the cafe. Coordinating the schedule with other members in Blue House has become a frequent event. Consuming several cups of coffee, my team and I have planned Lunar New Year events, field trip to the Golden Gate Bridge, and Chinese lunch in school to help international students feel more at home. Straightening my back and bracing my shoulders, I stood up behind the conference table and expressed my creative ideas passionately. After each meeting, we shared buttermilk coffee-cake.                 In my spot next to the window, I also witnessed different kinds of people. I viewed visitors dragging their luggage, women carrying shopping bags, and people wandering in tattered clothes --the diversity of San Francisco. Two years ago I saw volunteers wearing City Impact shirts offering sandwiches and hot chocolate to homeless people outside of the cafe. I investigated more about City Impact and eventually signed up to volunteer. No longer was I a bystander. At holiday outreach events, I prepared and delivered food to homeless people. While sharing my coffee, I listened to a story from an older Chinese man who told me, in Mandarin, how he had been abandoned by his children and felt lonely.Last summer, I returned to Xiamen, China, and taught my father how to drink coffee. Now, a Chemex and teapot are both on the end table. Instead of simply listening, I shared my experiences as a club president, a community leader, and a volunteer. I showed him my business plan and prototypes. My father raised his cup of coffee and made a toast to me, “Good girl! I am so proud of you.” Then, he patted my head as before. Together, we emptied our cups while the smell of coffee lingered.","Essay Critique:

"I add the critically measured sugary tea mixture to the gallon jar containing the slimy, white, disc-shaped layers of the symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast.Now to wait.  After exactly seven days, I pour the liquid into a fermentation-grade glass bottle with a ratio of 20% pomegranate juice and 80% fermented tea. I place it on my kitchen counter, periodically checking it to relieve the built-up CO2.Finally, after an additional seventy-two hours, the time comes to try it. I crack the seal on the bottle, leaning over to smell what I assume will be a tangy, fruity, delicious pomegranate solution. and it smells like rotten eggs. The insufferable stench fills my nostrils and crushes my confidence. I'm momentarily taken aback, unable to understand how I went wrong when I followed the recipe perfectly. My issue wasn't misreading the recipe or failing to follow a rule, it was bypassing my creative instincts and forgetting the unpredictable nature of fermentation. I needed to trust the creative side of kombucha— the side that takes people's perfectionist energy and explodes it into a puddle of rotten egg smelling 'booch (my preferred name for the drink- not ""fermented, effervescent liquid from a symbiotic culture of acetic acid bacteria and yeast""). I was too caught up in the side that requires extreme preciseness to notice when the balance between perfectionism and imperfectionism was being thrown off. The key, I have learned, is knowing when to prioritize following the recipe and when to let myself be creative. Sure, there are scientific variables such as proximity to heat sources and how many grams of sugar to add. But, there's also person-dependent variables like how long I decide to ferment it, what fruits I decide will be a fun combination, and which friend I got my first SCOBY from (taking ""symbiotic"" to a new level).I often find myself feeling pressured to choose one side or the other, one extreme over the alternative. I've been told that I can either be a meticulous scientist or a messy artist, but to be both is an unacceptable contradiction. However, I choose a grey area; a place where I can channel my creativity into the sciences, as well as channel my precision into my photography.I still have the first photo I ever took on the first camera I ever had. Or rather, the first camera I ever made. Making that pinhole camera was truly a painstaking process: take a cardboard box, tap it shut, and poke a hole in it. Okay, maybe it wasn't that hard. But learning the exact process of taking and developing a photo in its simplest form, the science of it, is what drove me to pursue photography. I remember being so unhappy with the photo I took; it was faded, underexposed, and imperfect. For years, I felt incredibly pressured to try and perfect my photography. It wasn't until I was defeated, staring at a puddle of kombucha, that I realized that there doesn't always have to be a standard of perfection in my art, and that excited me. So, am I a perfectionist? Or do I crave pure spontaneity and creativity? Can I be both?Perfectionism leaves little to be missed. With a keen eye, I can quickly identify my mistakes and transform them into something with purpose and definitude. On the other hand, imperfection is the basis for change and for growth. My resistance against perfectionism is what has allowed me to learn to move forward by seeing the big picture; it has opened me to new experiences, like bacteria cross-culturing to create something new, something different, something better. I am not afraid of change or adversity, though perhaps I am afraid of conformity. To fit the mold of perfection would compromise my creativity, and I am not willing to make that sacrifice.","Essay Critique:

Overall Score: 80

Strengths:
- The essay demonstrates a clear passion and interest in kombucha-making and photography, showing the student's dedication and commitment to these pursuits.
- The use of descriptive language, such as ""disc-shaped layers of the symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast"" and ""rotten egg smelling 'booch',"" adds vividness to the essay and makes the reader more engaged.
- The essay presents a theme of balancing creativity and precision, showcasing the student's ability to navigate between two seemingly opposing qualities.

Areas of Concern:
- The introduction of the kombucha-making process is well-written, but the essay becomes less focused and digresses into discussing photography. While the connection between these two interests is eventually made, it could be stronger and more cohesive throughout the essay.
- More specific examples and anecdotes related to kombucha-making and photography could enhance the essay's impact and make it more memorable.
- The conclusion feels slightly abrupt and unfinished. It does not bring the essay to a satisfying resolution or leave the reader with a lasting message.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Strengthen the connection between kombucha-making and photography: Throughout the essay, find ways to tie the two interests together more explicitly. Discuss how the creative aspects of kombucha-making inform the student's approach to photography, and vice versa. This will create a more coherent and impactful narrative.

2. Provide more specific examples: Rather than speaking in general terms about creativity and precision, provide concrete examples of how the student utilizes both in their pursuits. Share specific experiences or projects that illustrate the balance between these qualities.

3. Develop a more impactful conclusion: Ensure that the conclusion brings the essay to a satisfying close and leaves the reader with a strong takeaway. Consider reflecting on the lessons learned from balancing creativity and precision, and how these qualities will continue to shape the student's future pursuits and contributions.

Remember to revise and polish the essay for clarity, coherence, and conciseness. Take this feedback as an opportunity to further refine and strengthen the personal statement, making it stand out to admissions officers. Good luck!"
"I hold onto my time as dearly as my Scottish granny holds onto her money. I’m careful about how I spend it and fearful of wasting it. Precious minutes can show someone I care and can mean the difference between accomplishing a goal or being too late to even start and my life depends on carefully budgeting my time for studying, practicing with my show choir, and hanging out with my friends. However, there are moments where the seconds stand still.It is already dark when I park in my driveway after a long day at school and rehearsals. I can’t help but smile when I see my dog Kona bounce with excitement, then slide across the tile floor to welcome me as I open the door. I run with him into my parent’s bedroom, where my mom, dad, and sister are waiting for me. We pile onto my parents’ bed to talk about what’s going on in our lives, plan our next trip to the beach, tell jokes, and “spill tea.” They help me see challenges with a realistic perspective, grounding me in what matters. Not paying attention to the clock, I allow myself to relax for a brief moment in my busy life.Laughter fills the show choir room as my teammates and I pass the time by telling bad jokes and breaking out in random bursts of movement. Overtired, we don’t even realize we’re entering the fourth hour of rehearsal. This same sense of camaraderie follows us onstage, where we become so invested in the story we are portraying we lose track of time. My show choir is my second family. I realize I choreograph not for recognition, but to help sixty of my best friends find their footing. At the same time, they help me find my voice.The heavy scuba gear jerks me under the icy water, and exhilaration washes over me. Lost in the meditative rolling effect of the tide and the hum of the vast ocean, I feel present. I dive deeper to inspect a vibrant community of creatures, and we float together, carefree and synchronized. My fascination with marine life led me to volunteer as an exhibit interpreter for the Aquarium of the Pacific, where I share my love for the ocean. Most of my time is spent rescuing animals from small children and, in turn, keeping small children from drowning in the tanks. I’ll never forget the time when a visiting family and I were so involved in discussing ocean conservation that, before I knew it, an hour had passed. Finding this mutual connection over the love of marine life and the desire to conserve the ocean environment keeps me returning each summer. “Why don’t we have any medical supplies?” The thought screams through my mind as I carry a sobbing girl on my back across campus in search of an ice pack and ankle wrap. She had just fallen while performing, and I could relate to the pain and fear in her eyes. The chaos of the show becomes distant, and I devote my time to bringing her relief, no matter how long it may take. I find what I need to treat her injury in the sports medicine training room. I didn’t realize she would be the first of many patients I would tend to in this training room. Since then, I’ve launched a sports medicine program to provide care to the 500-person choir program.  Saturday morning bagels with my family. Singing backup for Barry Manilow with my choir. Swimming with sea turtles in the Pacific. Making my teammate smile even though he’s in pain. These are the moments I hold onto, the ones that define who I am, and who I want to be. For me, time isn’t just seconds ticking by on a clock, it’s how I measure what matters.","Essay Critique:

"“Mommy I can’t see myself.” I was six when I first refused/rejected girl’s clothing, eight when I only wore boy’s clothing, and fifteen when I realized why. When gifted dresses I was told to “smile and say thank you” while Spiderman shirts took no prompting from me, I’d throw my arms around the giver and thank them. My whole life has been others invading my gender with their questions, tears signed by my body, and a war against my closet. Fifteen years and I finally realized why, this was a girl’s body, and I am a boy. Soon after this, I came out to my mom. I explained how lost I felt, how confused I was, how “I think I’m Transgender.” It was like all those years of being out of place had led to that moment, my truth, the realization of who I was. My mom cried and said she loved me. The most important factor in my transition was my mom’s support. She scheduled me an appointment with a gender therapist, let me donate my female clothes, and helped build a masculine wardrobe. With her help, I went on hormones five months after coming out and got surgery a year later. I finally found myself, and my mom fought for me, her love was endless. Even though I had friends, writing, and therapy, my strongest support was my mother.On August 30th, 2018 my mom passed away unexpectedly. My favorite person, the one who helped me become the man I am today, ripped away from me, leaving a giant hole in my heart and in my life.Life got dull. Learning how to wake up without my mom every morning became routine. Nothing felt right, a constant numbness to everything, and fog brain was my kryptonite. I paid attention in class, I did the work, but nothing stuck. I felt so stupid, I knew I was capable, I could solve a Rubik’s cube in 25 seconds and write poetry, but I felt broken. I was lost, I couldn’t see myself, so stuck on my mother that I fell into an ‘It will never get better’ mindset.It took over a year to get out of my slump. 25 therapy sessions, over 40 poems, not a single one didn’t mention my mom. I shared my writing at open mics, with friends, and I cried every time. I embraced the pain, the hurt, and eventually, it became the norm. I grew used to not having my mom around.My mom always wanted to change the world, to fix the broken parts of society. She didn’t get to. Now that I’m in a good place, mentally and physically, I’m going to make that impact. Not just for her, but for me, and all the people who need a support branch as strong as the one my mom gave me.I’m starting with whats impacted me most of my life, what’s still in front of me, being Transgender in the school system. For my senior project, I am using my story and experience as a young Transgender man to inform local schools, specifically the staff, about the do’s and dont’s of dealing with a Transgender student. I am determined to make sure no one feels as alone as I did. I want to be able to reach people, and use motivational speaking as the platform. After experiencing many twists and turns in my life, I’m finally at a good spot. I know what I want to do with my life, and I know how I’m going to get there. Mom, I can see myself now. Thank you.","Essay critique:

4. Concrete examples: The writer provides specific examples, such as donating their clothes, seeking therapy, and undergoing surgery, which add credibility and depth to their narrative.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of academic or extracurricular focus: While the personal statement is moving and impactful, it doesn't thoroughly address the student's academic interests, achievements, or involvement in extracurricular activities.
2. Limited exploration of future goals: The student briefly mentions wanting to make an impact and educate others about transgender issues, but doesn't provide specific details about their career aspirations or how they plan to achieve their goals.
3. Grammatical errors: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings in the essay that should be addressed to improve clarity and readability.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Expand on academic and extracurricular interests: Incorporate a paragraph or two that highlights the student's academic strengths, interests, and accomplishments. This will help admissions officers see the student as a well-rounded individual.
2. Develop future goals: Elaborate on the student's aspirations beyond their senior project. Discuss how they plan to use their experiences as a transgender man to contribute to their chosen field or make a broader impact on society.
3. Address grammatical errors: Proofread the essay carefully and correct any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings to improve the overall clarity and flow of the writing.

Rating: 80/100

This personal statement effectively conveys the student's personal journey and resilience, but it could benefit from further development of academic and future goals. Additionally, addressing the grammatical errors will help enhance the overall quality of the essay."
"Are you tired of seeing an iPhone everywhere? Samsung glitchy? It’s time for a change. I present to you, the iTaylor. I am the iTaylor. On the outside, I look like any smart phone, but when you open my settings and explore my abilities, you will find I have many unique features.The iTaylor’s best feature is its built-in optimism. Thanks to my positivity, I was chosen to give the morning announcements freshman year. Now, I am the alarm clock for the 1,428 students of Fox Lane High School. For the past three years, I have been starting everyone’s morning with a bubbly, “Good morning, foxes!” and ending with “Have a marvelous Monday,” “Terrific Tuesday” or “Phenomenal Friday!”  My adjective-a-day keeps people listening, gives me conversation starters with faculty, and solicits fun suggestions from my friends.Next up, language settings. I’ve worked hard to be bilingual so the iTaylor can be set to either English or Spanish. Fun fact: In middle school, I set my phone to Spanish so that messages like “Alexis te envió un mensaje en Instagram,” would increase my fluency. I learned nuances of the language by watching Spanish sitcoms like Siete Vidas and Spanish movies like Como Agua Para Chocolate. I appreciate the emphasis Spanish culture places on relationships, the way siblings take care of each other, and how grandparents’ wisdom is valued. Inspired, I began creating family events and even making efforts to grow closer to my second cousins.At eight years old, I was diagnosed with what some might call a glitch: epilepsy. Fortunately, a new IOS software update cured my condition by the age of 15, but through epilepsy, I gained a love of exploration. Whereas at 10, I couldn’t bathe without supervision, I now enjoy snorkeling in unknown waters. While at 11, I couldn’t be left alone with my friends, I now explore the subways, crowded streets, and Broadway shows of New York City. Overcoming epilepsy taught me to take risks and explore new places.This brings us to the iTaylor location settings. Two summers ago, I travelled to Ecuador to live with a friend’s family and teach Spanish theater to third graders. The experience implanted a “cookie” in me, filling me with a desire to learn about different cultures. I brought this desire home to a volunteer position at a local program for immigrant children. I helped the kids make presentations about their places of origin, including Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Also, as resident tour guide and ambassador for exchange students at my school, I’ve discovered North African fusion music from Selima, learned German slang from Henrike, and helped Saidimar prepare his Mr.Sulu campaign, a regional pageant in the Philippines. It became clear that the English language, one I took for granted, is the central feature that brings groups together.This past summer, I brought my talents to Scotland, playing the dual role of  Artistic Director and leading character for Geek the Musical. I worked to promote the show in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival against 53,232 shows, reinventing ways to motivate the cast and connect with strangers from all over the world. We learned the more we connected, the more our audience grew. I applied these skills to my leadership positions at home, including my High School Theater Group, Players. I’m now better at creating a marketing strategy that includes door-to-door sales, print advertising, and identifying broader target audiences to fill seats.The rollout plan for the iTaylor is to introduce it to the theater market. My goal is to use performance and storytelling to expose audiences to different cultures, religions, and points of view. Perhaps if we all learned more about each other's lifestyles, the world would be more empathetic and integrated. So what do you think? Would you like an iTaylor of your own? The iTaylor College Edition is now available for pre-order. It delivers next fall.","Essay Critique:

"""Perfect as the wing of a bird may be, it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air."" --Ivan Pavlov Upon graduation, I will be able to analyze medieval Spanish poems using literary terms and cultural context, describe the electronegativity trends on the periodic table, and identify when to use logarithmic differentiation to simplify a derivative problem. Despite knowing how to execute these very particular tasks, I currently fail to understand how to change a tire, how to do my taxes efficiently, or how to obtain a good insurance policy. A factory-model school system that has been left essentially unchanged for nearly a century has been the driving force in my educational development.I have been conditioned to complete tasks quickly, efficiently, and with an advanced understanding. I measured my self-worth as my ability to outdo my peers academically, thinking my scores were the only aspect that defined me; and they were. I was getting everything right. Then, I ran for Student Government and failed. Rejection. I didn’t even make it past the first round of cuts. How could that be? I was statistically a smart kid with a good head on my shoulders, right? Surely someone had to have made a mistake. Little did I know, this was my first exposure to meaning beyond numbers.As I was rejected from StuGo for the second year in a row, I discovered I had been wrongfully measuring my life through numbers--my football statistics, my test scores, my age, my height (I’m short). I had the epiphany that oh wait, maybe it was my fault that I had never prioritized communication skills, or open-mindedness (qualities my fellow candidates possessed). Maybe it was me. That must be why I always had to be the one to approach people during my volunteer hours at the public library to offer help--no one ever asked me for it. I resolved to alter my mindset, taking a new approach to the way I lived. From now on I would emphasize qualitative experiences over quantitative skills. I had never been more uncomfortable. I forced myself to learn to be vulnerable by asking questions even if I was terrified of being wrong. My proficiency in using data evidence could not teach me how to communicate with young children at church, nor could my test scores show me how to be more open to criticism. The key to all of these skills, I was to discover, happened to be learning from those around me. Turns out, I couldn’t do everything by myself.The process of achieving this new mindset came through the cultivation of relationships. I became fascinated by the new perspectives each person in my life could offer if I really took the time to connect. Not only did I improve my listening skills, but I began to consider the big-picture consequences my engagements could have. People interpret situations differently due to their own cultural contexts, so I had to learn to pay more attention to detail to understand every point of view. I took on the state of what I like to call collaborative independence, and to my delight, I was elected to StuGo after my third year of trying.Not long ago, I would have fallen apart at the presence of any uncertainty. As I further accept and advance new life skills, the more I realize how much remains uncertain in the world. After all, it is quite possible my future job doesn’t exist yet, and that’s okay. I can’t conceivably plan out my entire life at the age of 17, but what I can do is prepare myself to take on the unknown, doing my best to accompany others. Hopefully, my wings continue enabling me to fly, but it is going to take more than just me and my wings; I have to continue putting my faith in the air around me.","Essay Critique:

Overall Score: 78

Strengths:
- The essay begins with a strong and engaging quote from Ivan Pavlov, which sets the tone and captures the reader's attention.
- The writer effectively conveys a clear contrast between their academic prowess and their lack of practical life skills, such as changing a tire or doing taxes, which adds depth to their personal narrative.
- The exploration of the factory-model school system and its impact on the writer's development is thought-provoking and demonstrates critical thinking.
- The essay shows growth and self-reflection as the writer realizes the importance of qualitative experiences and interpersonal skills.
- The emphasis on cultivating relationships and learning from others is a valuable lesson that the writer has learned.

Areas of Concern:
- The structure of the essay could be improved. There should be a more impactful introduction that connects the quote to the writer's personal experience, as well as a cohesive conclusion that wraps up the main ideas of the essay.
- Though the essay is personal, there is room for more vulnerability and emotional depth. The writer could go beyond simply stating their realization and explore the emotions and thoughts that accompanied it.
- The essay lacks specific examples to support the writer's claims and experiences. This makes the essay feel somewhat generic and less compelling.
- There is a missed opportunity to provide concrete examples of how the writer has applied their newfound mindset and skills in real-life situations. Including specific anecdotes could further strengthen the essay.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the introduction to provide a more direct connection between the quote and the writer's personal experience. This will help to hook the reader and create a stronger impact from the beginning.
2. Consider structuring the essay in a way that highlights the transformation from focusing on academic achievements to valuing qualitative experiences. This can be achieved by using clear section headers and organizing the essay accordingly.
3. To add emotional depth, reflect on the writer's feelings of rejection, vulnerability, and growth. Instead of simply stating the discoveries and realizations, show the reader how these experiences impacted the writer on a deeper level.
4. Incorporate specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate the writer's journey of learning from others and developing interpersonal skills. This will make the essay more engaging and memorable for the reader.
5. In the conclusion, reiterate the main ideas of the essay and provide a sense of closure. Consider leaving the reader with a thought-provoking question or statement that encourages further reflection.

Overall, this essay has potential, but it could benefit from more personal and specific details that showcase the writer's unique experiences and growth. With some revisions and additions, it could effectively convey the writer's transformation and make a lasting impression on college admissions officers."
"My mom opened Kanishka’s Gastropub in 2013. I was ecstatic. We would become the first Mother-Son Indian duo on Food Network peeling potatoes, skinning chicken, and grinding spices, sharing our Bengali recipes with the world. However, the restaurant tore apart my parent’s relationship. Two years after opening, my dad started coming home late most nights, plastered from “happy hour with work colleagues.” My mom, trying to balance her day job at Kaiser and owning a restaurant, poured her stress on me,“What the hell is wrong with you! Always watching YouTube and never talking!” The worst time came when my parents tried to fix their relationship. Repeated date nights induced more arguments. Enduring the stress of her restaurant, my father, and her mistakes, my mom attempted to end her life. Fortunately, I found her just in time.  Over the next two years, things were at times still hard, but gradually improved. My parents decided to start anew, took some time apart, then got back together. My mom started to pick me up from activities on time and my dad and I bonded more, watching Warriors and 49ers games. But at times I still had to emotionally support my mom to avoid sudden India trips, or put my siblings to bed if my parents weren’t home at night. Over time, I found it difficult being my family’s glue. I wanted back the family I had before the restaurant--the one that ate Luchi Mongsho together every Sunday night.        So I looked for comfort in creation. I began spending more time in our garage, carefully constructing planes from sheets of foam. I found purpose balancing the fuselage or leveling the ailerons to precisely 90 degrees. I loved cutting new parts and assembling them perfectly. Here, I could fix all the mistakes. In high school, I slowly began to forge a community of creators with my peers. Sophomore year, I started an engineering club and found that I had a talent for  managing people and encouraging them to create an idea even if it failed. I also learned how to take feedback and become more resilient. Here, I could nerd-out about warp drives and the possibility of anti-matter without being ignored. I would give a weekly report on new technology and we would have hour-long conversations about the various uses a blacker material could have. While building a community at school rebuilt my confidence, I still found I enjoyed being alone at times. While driving in my car, I’d let my mind wander to movies like Big Hero Six and contemplate if a zero-friction bike really was possible. I’d create ideas like an AI highway system that tells drivers exactly when to switch lanes based on timing and calculus to prevent braking from nearby cars. Or I’d blueprint a new classroom with interactive desks, allowing students to dive deep into historical events like a VR game. I found outlining complex ideas like these sometimes provide insights into something I’m researching or could one day materialize into future projects. Looking back (and perhaps inadvertently), the conflicts from the restaurant days have taught me valuable lessons. Helping my mom through her relationship taught me to watch out for those in emotional distress. Spending nights alone made me more independent--after all, it was then that I signed up for advanced math and programming courses and decided to apply for software internships. Most of all, seeing my mom start her restaurant from no food-industry experience inspired me to found two clubs and a Hydrogen Car Team. Even though we eat Luchi Monsho on a monthly basis now, I know my family will never be the way it was. My mom and I won’t become a Food Network mother-son duo. I can’t fix all the mistakes. But I can use them to improve the present.","Essay Score: 82

"In 8th grade while doing a school project I Googled my dad's name and it came up in US military documents posted on the Snowden/NSA documents on WikiLeaks. I stayed up all night reading through documents related to Army support contracts in Iraq and Kuwait in 2003. I asked my dad about it the next day and he said, ""It was a mistake I made that has been resolved."" Turns out it hadn't been.Saudi Arabia in the 2000s wasn’t the most ideal place to grow up. I was always scared of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda. My school was part of the US Consulate in Dhahran, and when I was in the 8th grade it was threatened by ISIS. Violence has always surrounded me and haunted me. After 14 years of living in a region destroyed by violence, I was sent away to boarding school in a region known for peace, Switzerland. That year my father was found guilty and imprisoned for the charges related to his Army support contract. I felt as if I was Edgar in Shakespeare’s King Lear and this could not get worse, but yet it did.My parents got divorced and my childhood home was bulldozed to the ground by the Saudi government after my father was sent to prison. My mom had always been a hub of stability, but she was too overwhelmed to support me. I started eating to cope with my anxiety and gained 100 pounds in a year and a half. As I gained weight, my health started to deteriorate, and my grades started to drop. Things began to change at the beginning of my sophomore year, however, when I met my new roommate, Nico. He had grown up with someone whose father was also in prison, and was able to help me better understand the issues I was facing. Through my friendship with Nico, I learned how to open up and get support from my friends. I started to make new friends with more people at my school and was surprised to find out that 90% of their parents were divorced. Because we faced similar issues, we were able to support one and other, share tactics, and give advice. One of my friends, John, gave me advice on how to help my mother emotionally by showing her love, something I hadn’t been able to do before. My friends gave me a family and a home, when my own family was overwhelmed and my home was gone.Slowly, I put my life back on track. I started playing basketball, began working on a CubeSAT, learned to program, changed my diet, and lost all the weight I had gained.  Now my friends in Switzerland come to me asking me for advice and help, and I feel as if I am a vital member of our community. My close friend Akshay recently started stressing about whether his parents were going to get divorced. With John’s advice, I started checking in on Akshay, spending more time with him, and coaching him before and after he talked to his parents. Leaving home in the beginning of my adolescence, I was sent out on a path of my own. While for some, high school is the best time of their lives, for me, high school has represented some of the best and, hopefully, worst times. Even with the struggles I’ve faced with my family, I am grateful for this path. It has brought me to a place that I only thought was fictional. In this new place I feel like a real person, with real emotions. This place is somewhere where I can express myself freely and be who I want to be. I am a much stronger, healthier, and more resilient person than I was two years ago. While it hasn’t been easy, I am glad to be where I am today.","Essay Critique:

Overall, this personal statement has significant potential to resonate with admissions officers and draw their attention.

"I have always been a very rational and logical thinker. This is why I enjoy almost all math and science courses. So here's an equation for you:

The easiest way for me to solve any problem is to put it in a form that will make it easier to understand and solve. For this particular problem I will give you a personal experience that incorporates all of the above variables and we'll find out together what the answer to this equation is and just maybe how to solve it.

It was a regular Friday afternoon in December when I experienced an act of prejudice towards me. It wasn't the first, but I was old enough to evaluate this situation on my own. I was at a basketball game with my best friend when an older woman began talking to us. She told us who her grandson was (he was on the opposing team) and that she was visiting for the holidays all the way from Iowa. When the conversation came to a halt she asked us whether or not we were students at Peddie or with the visiting team. We informed her that we were indeed boarding students at Peddie. Her next statement was, ""Isn't that great. This is a real expensive school. Do you two play sports?"" We looked at each other with bewilderment, and responded in a light hearted manner, ""Well we play for fun, but we aren't masters at any sport."" That led her to ask, ""Well are you on financial aid?"" Needless to say, we were speechless.

Now let's look at the equation in regards with my experience. Two different kinds of assumptions? CHECK. Ignorance on her behalf? CHECK. Were we different? CHECK. Everything seems to fit, now let's break it down to understand more effectively. This woman assumed that since we were African American we had to play a sport, and when she found out that we didn't her next guess was immediately to assume we needed financial aid. Where did these assumptions come from? This is where the second part of our equation comes in: ignorance. Her ignorance—not mean spiritedness, but ignorance—led her to believe certain things about a race of people. And ignorance comes from not knowing or understanding people's differences. Add everything up and what do you get: stereotypes.

Now looking back on this experience I have come to realize that there were some stereotypical actions on my behalf as well. Did I assume that the woman was assuming that I was poor because of my race? Yes. Was it my ignorance or blindness that made my mind go straight to racism and not think of any other possibilities? Yes. Was it the differences between us, older white woman and teenage black girl, that made me automatically point the finger at this woman? Replaying the sequence of events back in mind I would have to say, YES! This makes me think, stereotypes are everywhere. They don't solely exist within the majority. Everyone, even the minority, are capable of being stereotypical and judgmental.

Now, let's review,

This is where I come in; I propose a new equation that will help fix the problems with stereotypes on any level. After some deep thought and inner monologue here is the new and improved equation:

If we replace our assumptions and preconceived notions with actual facts and truth, half of the problem with prejudice is already solved. Now add education into the mix, and we empower people to think for themselves and not listen to the heightened half truths being told all over. Lastly, when there is acceptance of everyone's differences (because differences are inevitable), then and only then will we achieve: understanding. And understanding is what is needed for everything to prosper.

Taking a second look, I might have jumped the gun, because this older woman seemed harmless, she might have simply been coming from a curious place. I needed a little more understanding and maybe I could have been a little more sensitive. Or maybe she did mean it in the racist way, we'll never know. But this is what life's about, learning from your past decisions and using those experiences to shape your future choices. Without this incident, I might not have been forced to think about stereotypes and open my eyes to the fact that they really do exist.www.cracksat.net","I would rate this essay a 60 out of 100. The essay effectively highlights a personal experience that sheds light on the issue of stereotypes and prejudice. The use of an equation as a thematic device is unique and helps to frame the argument. The writer also demonstrates introspection and growth by acknowledging their own assumptions and biases.

One of the strengths of this essay is the clear structure and organization. The writer effectively introduces the topic and personal experience, breaks down the equation and explains its components, and concludes with a new equation for combating stereotypes. This structure helps to guide the reader through the essay and keeps the argument focused.

However, there are also areas of concern in this essay. The introduction is weak and does not grab the reader's attention. It would be more effective to start with a compelling anecdote or a thought-provoking question. Additionally, the essay lacks depth and specificity in its analysis of the personal experience. The writer briefly mentions the incident and stereotypes, but does not delve into the impact on their own emotions or the broader implications. Adding more details and emotional depth would make the essay more compelling.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more development of the new equation for combating stereotypes. The writer briefly introduces the idea, but does not explore it fully or provide concrete examples or evidence to support their argument. Adding specific strategies or actions that individuals can take to challenge stereotypes would strengthen the essay and make it more persuasive.

In terms of improvement, I would suggest revising the introduction to make it more engaging and attention-grabbing. Additionally, I would recommend expanding on the personal experience to provide more context and emotional depth. Finally, I would encourage the writer to develop the new equation further by providing specific examples or strategies for combatting stereotypes.

Overall, this essay has potential but needs further development and specific examples to strengthen the argument and make it more compelling. With revisions and additions, this essay could become a powerful statement that resonates with college admissions officers."
"A ball is rolled down the lane. Confidently, I turn around; there is no need to see the result. A perfect strike. I stroll back to the bench, receiving high-fives from not only my teammates, but the opposing team as well. Bowling has been my most satisfying extracurricular activity. Turning with a smile on my face to my teammates knowing I threw a strike, without having to see it, feels amazing. On the other hand, it can prove a little embarrassing when a pin is left standing.

When I was in ninth grade, I tried out and made the freshmen basketball team. Spending almost the entire season on the bench was not an enjoyable experience. While my spirit to play was strong, my height of 5'2"" was an impediment. The next year I decided to try bowling instead of putting myself through another year of warming the bench. Bowling is an equal opportunity sport, where it doesn't matter if you're short, fat, or even deaf, dumb, and blind. It is the only sport I know of that you can eat french fries and play cards during practice. Bowling matches and practices are always fun as we never have to do strenuous wind sprints and no one ever gets injured. My teammates and I get to relax and have fun.

On good days, it is satisfying to know that I can throw a strike on any shot. My best game to date is a 266. On the other hand, I have also experienced the ""agony"" of getting a gutter ball. We often joke with each other about throwing gutter balls; claiming it ""hit my leg"" to use as an excuse.

It is amazing to see how although as individuals we don't have a lot in common, yet as teammates, we bond. The team is very sup-portive; we cheer when someone does well and give encouragement when one of us throws a bad shot. I have never quite experienced that kind of team sportsmanship before. As a varsity bowler, I enjoy helping the younger JV bowlers perfect their game. I have spent numerous practices working with one freshman in particular to improve his approach to the shot (unfortunately, my efforts had limited success).

My own game has improved as well. Sophomore year, when we went to the Westchester/Putnam sectionals, I was really nervous and I did not bowl up to the expectations I had for myself. In contrast, junior year, we qualified again and I averaged fifteen pins better than my season average. My skills, along with my confidence, had significantly improved. This newfound confidence has spread to other areas of my life. Recently, I had to give a speech for Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society) and I was pleasantly surprised with the ease I felt at delivering the speech. While bowling is not as glamorous as football or basketball (no cheerleaders), for me it will always be wonderful way to spend an afternoon.www.cracksat.net","Essay Critique:

1. The essay effectively highlights the author's passion for bowling and how it has become a satisfying extracurricular activity for them.
2. The author's struggles with not being able to play basketball due to their height and their decision to try bowling instead shows resilience and determination.
3. The essay briefly mentions the author's personal growth and improved confidence through bowling and how it has positively impacted other areas of their life.

Areas of concern:
1. The introduction is weak and lacks a clear hook or attention-grabbing element. Consider starting with a more engaging anecdote or a captivating opening sentence to draw the reader in.
2. The essay lacks a clear structure or flow, making it difficult to follow. Consider organizing the content into distinct paragraphs with each focusing on a specific aspect of the author's bowling experience (e.g., joining the team, personal growth, impact on others).
3. The essay relies heavily on general statements without providing specific examples or anecdotes to support the author's claims. Add more concrete details and personal stories to make the essay more engaging and relatable.
4. The essay lacks depth and fails to explore the author's motivations, goals, and aspirations beyond bowling. Consider expanding on how bowling has shaped the author's character, influenced their values, and contributed to their personal development.

"November 23, Two years ago: 
Thanksgiving. My mom and I celebrated the holiday as we had done for the
 last three years—by delivering turkey dinners to homebound senior 
citizens. After carrying the food to their kitchens, our brief visits 
with them were flled with laughter, hugs, and the sharing of family 
photo albums. In the midst of all the warmth and vitality, though, I 
couldn't help noticing the signs of loneliness and isolation: the 
windows with dust suggesting they hadn't been open in ages, the faded 
Christmas cards from 1995, and the tables with a single place setting. 
It was during these visits that I committed to fnd a way to better 
connect with the seniors in my community.



I discussed my desire with the mayor of Fremont in December two 
years ago. He agreed that a younger voice could prove to be benefcial 
and mentioned the Senior Citizen Commission for the City of Fremont (an 
advisory board to City Council that worked to directly address the needs
 of local seniors). I formally applied to the Commission and was 
unanimously appointed by City Council in February last year, becoming 
the youngest Commissioner in Fremont's history.



Although I was initially met with skepticism from my fellow Senior 
Citizen Commissioners, I was committed to sharing my vision of the 
benefts of intergenerational interactions. For the next two months, my 
after-school hours were devoted to calling nursing homes, negotiating 
with movie theater managers, and recruiting teen volunteers. The 
resulting event was the Senior Movie Outing, which paired teenagers with
 wheelchair-bound seniors for a fun afternoon at the movies.As a result 
of my hard work on the successful outing and the rave reviews from all 
who participated, my fellow Commissioners became more respectful of my 
contributions and open to my input. During the annual grant-reviewing 
period (when the Commission decides which non-proft organizations will 
receive City funding), I advocated to fund Lavender Seniors, an 
organization which supports gay and lesbian seniors. While it had not 
previously been funded by the City, I strongly believed it fell within 
the Commission's charter of ""serving the needs of all seniors."" After 
sharing my rationale for proposing to fund Lavender Seniors, I was proud
 that the Commissioners kept an open mind and the majority voted to 
grant the organization funding.



In the two years since my appointment, I have cherished the unique 
opportunities I have had to learn from people with different 
perspectives and backgrounds. My time on the Commission has taught me to
 be more confdent when expressing my ideas, and to be more open to 
hearing others' thoughts. I am proud to be a trusted voice for seniors 
in my community.","Essay Score: 90

"I BELIEVE IN PEOPLE. THIS CONVICTION drives my action and ambitions, and defnes me in a world of cynicism and doubt. I have seen the power of people and their ability to come together in times of need and joy and sorrow. I know that ultimately, humans strive for belonging and community; thus, while loneliness and anger may always be in existence, so will be togetherness and bliss. My strong faith in humanity stems from my witnessing of the best in human qualities while doing the MS150 and during Hurricane Ike, and pushes me to pursue a career in helping others. Both of these events have allowed me to see humanity at its best, performing selfess acts of benevolence.

For the past four years, I have participated in the BPMS150 bike tour from Houston to Austin. This 175 mile ride raises funds for the national MS Society, which sponsors medical research for multiple sclerosis and aids the families of its victims. I can say from experience, the ride is grueling; enormous hills, headwinds, fatigue, and body aches are prevalent throughout. Yet every year, over thirteen thousand riders decide to put their minds and bodies through two days of torture so that they can help those who live with it every day. I have raised, over four years, more than eight thousand dollars to beneft the MS Society, and have never regretted any of the painful training or the ride itself. The view at the starting line is one of the most empowering I have ever witnessed: thousands of people, all of them with their hands on their handle bars, one foot poised on a pedal. All are ready to experience exhaustion for the beneft of others, like my father. He was diagnosed with MS when I was four, and is a constant motivator for me. I witnessed him become blind in one eye, and struggle with a body that refuses to function normally. I participate in this ride every year for him, as do thirteen thousand others. The power of people will ultimately help my father to receive better medical treatment, and maybe even one day, be cured.

While writing this essay, I was also able to observe and be a part of amazing human efforts. Hurricane Ike devastated Southeastern Texas, particularly the Houston and galveston areas. Much of my extended family lives in galveston, and so was forced to evacuate. Without hesitation, my parents opened up our home to aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, and pets. This is the environment in which I have always lived; our home is anyone's shelter, our food is anyone's nourishment. Together, our entire family weathered the storm, and comforted one another. My aunt's home received electrical power prior to my home, and so she eagerly welcomed us to stay with her. Large scale displays of altruism could be seen in the hundreds of University of Houston students handing out food and water to those affected by the hurricane. During times of need, people band together for safety and solace. Community is instinctual; dismiss the notions of survival of the fttest. People truly desire closeness with one another.

In the future, I hope to pursue a career in public health. I love studying science and math, and I would like to use this passion to beneft large numbers of people. Many go without basic medical treatment, and this causes a huge discrepancy in quality of life and health in the population. Even if this problem can never completely be solved, I want to help remedy this as much as possible. With small deeds and cooperative effort, humans can accomplish immense good. I know this because I believe in people, and I have seen them at their fnest.","Essay Critique:

Overall, this essay demonstrates a strong theme and passion for helping others, which is one of its main strengths. The writer effectively conveys their belief in the power of people through personal experiences with the MS150 bike tour and Hurricane Ike. The inclusion of personal anecdotes adds credibility to the writer's claims and helps the reader understand the motivation behind their desire to pursue a career in public health. Additionally, the essay flows well and maintains a clear focus throughout.

One area for improvement is the essay's organization. The writer should consider starting with a strong and attention-grabbing introduction that immediately hooks the reader. The current introduction is a bit weak and lacks the necessary impact to engage the reader from the start. Consider starting with a powerful anecdote or a thought-provoking question to grab the reader's attention and make them eager to continue reading.

Another concern is the writer's inconsistent use of formal language and proper punctuation. There are several instances of incorrect grammar and punctuation throughout the essay, which can be distracting and detract from the overall quality of the writing. To enhance the professionalism and impact of the essay, I recommend thoroughly proofreading and editing for grammar and punctuation errors. Consider seeking assistance from a teacher or writing tutor to ensure accuracy and clarity in your writing.

Additionally, while the personal anecdotes are effective in showcasing the writer's beliefs and experiences, the essay could benefit from more specific and concrete examples. For example, when discussing the MS150 bike tour, the writer could provide specific challenges they faced and the impact they witnessed on the MS Society. Adding specific details and examples will make the essay more engaging and memorable for the reader.

Lastly, the conclusion could be strengthened by tying the writer's personal experiences back to their future goals. How will their belief in people impact their career in public health? How do they plan to use small deeds and cooperative effort to make a difference? Expanding on these connections and offering a clear vision for the future will leave a lasting impression on the reader.

In terms of a rating, I would give this essay a score of 80. While there is room for improvement in organization, language usage, and providing specific examples, the essay effectively conveys the writer's passion and belief in the power of people. With some revisions and edits, this essay has the potential to be a compelling and memorable personal statement."
"I voted on November 2nd. As an eighteen-year-old woman in America, I am legally allowed to exercise my right to vote. Although my heart beat slightly fast, and my hands shook unsteadily at the polling booth, upon arriving home from my first voting experience, I was filled with a sense of accomplishment and relief. I sat on the couch that night, when I picked up a TIME magazine and began to read an article on Sudan by Massimo Calabresi.

The vast nation of Sudan is divided by both religion and culture, but mainly ethnicity: Arabs and Africans. While all citizens of Sudan are African, the nomadic tribes of Sudan are referred to as Arabs, while the sedentary tribes are called Africans.

The images I saw of the battling Arabs and Africans were stark and the stories I read were more horrific. The Janjaweed, ""devils on horseback,"" is an Arabic group of local tribes funded by the Sudanese government to crush the radical Sudan Liberation Army. The group began attacking civilians, claiming that they were aiding insurgents. Janjaweed ride or fly into African villages, firing guns on men and children alike. They rape the women, leave most children, and kill all the men. These are of course, very loose rules. One woman described a Janjaweed rampage: ""A fighter unwrapped a swaddling cloth and rolled a newborn baby onto the dirt. The baby was a girl, so they left her. Then the Janjaweed spotted a one-year-old boy and decided he was a future enemy. In front of a group of onlookers, a man tossed the boy into the air as another took aim and shot him dead.""

Suddenly voting didn't seem as important as it had fifteen minutes earlier. Suddenly I didn't want to go to school the next day, but fly to Africa and give all my hot lunches to a starving family at a refugee camp. What surprised me the most, however, was a common theme throughout the article about the lack of world response. We cannot let another Rwanda or Holocaust occur while we are alive. Genocide is supposed to be a thing of the past. It is a story we read about in books or a special we watch on the history channel. Let Sudan be the one time that the world learned and said ""never again"" and meant it.

As I sat on the couch, brimming with tears and watching the muted images of election results, I felt a desperate sense of despair. I had to remind myself that I am able to affect what happens in my life.

I voted on Tuesday. I am a woman. I am eighteen. And I had a choice. I am lucky, and I have the obligation to help people without my same rights. On Tuesday, what I voted for will not only affect my local and national community, but also the world. I am indebted to the citizens of countries like Sudan to vote for them, to give a voice to the people who cannot speak above the gunfire and violence that reigns in their country.

I realized then that my trip to the ballot box was perhaps not so futile and that I would indeed attend school the next day, no matter how great my desire to flee the country and save the world as a self-proclaimed knight-errant. I reminded myself that although I am an adult with adult responsibilities, I am still a senior in high school with plans to go to college. I can only hope that the best possible use of my time right now is to attend school to better educate myself. I can only hope that what I learn today will give me the courage and knowledge to stop tomorrow's Holocaust.www.cracksat.net

Areas of Concern:
- The essay lacks a clear structure or organization, making it difficult for the reader to follow the author's train of thought.

For example, you could start by describing your initial excitement about voting, then transition into your discovery of the crisis in Sudan, and end the essay with a reflection on how these experiences have shaped your desire to attend college and make a difference in the world.

2. Instead of summarizing the article on Sudan, try to focus on your personal response and reflection. How did the information you learned about the crisis affect you emotionally and intellectually? What questions or concerns did it raise for you? By delving deeper into your own thoughts and reactions, you can make the essay more engaging and personal.

3. Make connections between your desire to attend college and your passion for addressing issues like the crisis in Sudan. How do you envision a college education equipping you with the knowledge, skills, and resources to make a meaningful impact?

With these suggestions in mind, you can strengthen your personal statement and create a more compelling narrative that showcases your unique qualities and aspirations. Good luck!"
"Some nights we took the route along the Hudson River. My mom drove past the boisterous New York lights and down a few, potholed roads. She pulled to a stop in front of a small, gray building that crouched between a blinking medley of bodegas. The building's roof capped cracked cement walls and Pablo, a prominent preacher, stood at the doors to greet us. When a man's voice vibrated through a microphone, my mom rushed me towards the gathering room. Before we took our seats, she dropped a five dollar bill into the wooden collector's box, smiling at the nod of approval from the preacher on our left.

It was a plain room, easily confused for a hotel lobby with its bare, cream walls. Its only distinguishing feature was a glass-framed bookcase holding the Kingdom Hall's many biblical volumes. During my daily preparations, I often used Mi Libro de Historias Biblicas. My annotated copy trembled on my lap as I kicked the air, impatient. As a six year old, I was always eager to show off my new reading skills. When the speaker's words finally hitched up into a question, worm-like fingers wriggled wildly into the air. At the preacher's call, I answered, ""El futuro rei de la tierra,"" then beamed when my mom squeezed my hand, proud.

Jesus, Jehovah's son and "" the earth's future king."" It's strange to think I once believed those words. I memorized everything without question, including my mom's stories of Satan hiding in Catholic churches, which explained why my Catholic friends never attended mass. My mom told me of threatening, pointed arches stabbing the air and hundreds of candles casting taunting shadows against decaying stone walls. But most terrifying of all were her depictions of the statues: wide, unblinking eyes on ghostly pale faces, constantly watching and waiting. It was through these eyes, she said, that the Devil slithered out.

The images pierced me so deeply as a child that, just last year, I found myself unnerved as I walked towards my first cathédrale along la rue Saint-Mélaine; I feared that my mom's words might not have been as false as I had come to believe. Inside, wooden doors carved with delicate, twisting patterns opened to carefully painted murals lining le déambulatoire at the east end. A dazzling explosion of light filtered through the vitres all around me, a kaleidoscope of religious tales. The statues along the wall gazed serenely into the air. I saw no serpents in their water-clear eyes, but felt myself drawn by their outstretched arms. I cupped two smoothly chiseled hands, frozen in prayer. Somewhere to my right I heard a mother's soft murmurs of praise. ""Très bien, ma bichette. Très bien."" The words mingled with the sound of rustling footsteps, ricocheting like a thousand marbles let loose against the walls. I stepped out of this architectural masterpiece and away from my religious past. I set out to see more.www.cracksat.net

"As I step up to the pulpit, I feel a familiar sense of calm come over me, the calm I always experience before singing to my congregation. Scanning the audience, I look out at the parents and grandparents, making eye contact with those I recognize and those I do not. I begin to sing with my youth choir behind me, and take a deep breath in preparation for my solo. I can feel the eyes of the congregation locked onto me, waiting, and then my voice soars out over the expectant faces.

When I finish singing, I see rapt expressions and tears. Even though I know they would be touched regardless of how I sound, every time I sing at a service, I am overwhelmed by the amount of warmth that meets my participation.

""Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful."" I turn to see my cantor beaming at me, and I smile back. As I walk out of my synagogue, I am stopped repeatedly by wrinkly little women who grin unabashedly at me and well-wishers who say how much it means to them to see and hear young people at their Friday night service. The amount of praise I receive is almost embarrassing and feels somewhat undeserved, but it gives me joy and gratification that I can't find anywhere but here. Where else could you get a sticky, lipstick-smeared kiss from a complete stranger, and feel like it was the most heartfelt gesture in the world?

I have spent countless hours singing and performing, but there is a tangible difference between performing in a concert with my school choir and singing for my temple community. Whenever I contribute to my synagogue, I know that people appreciate my effort, whatever the results. To be able to participate without being judged gives me full rein to enjoy the experience. For this reason, belonging to a close-knit Jewish community has always been a vital part of my life. Over the years, I became more involved, moving from attending Sunday school classes to teaching younger students and helping to found my temple youth group. I joined the temple choir, chanted Torah on major holidays, and wrote for the temple bulletin. The more I undertook, the more I wanted to be active in my community. Gradually, my religion turned into a force that has grounded me and kept me centered throughout high school. An anchor point in my life, it has provided me with a rare sense of connection to my own identity and to the needs of those around me.

The summer I turned fifteen, I attended Kutz, a Jewish leadership camp, and was exposed to a vibrant and energetic group of teenagers. The passion that permeated the camp was infectious, and that summer, I realized that I wanted to devote my life to leading and nurturing a Jewish community. Abandoning my plans to become a doctor, which I had formed in kindergarten, I decided to pursue the goal of becoming a cantor. A cantor, similar to a rabbi, is a member of the Jewish clergy who leads a large portion of the song and prayer during a service. In pursuit of this ambition, I became the Religious and Cultural Vice President of my temple youth group, writing and leading services for teens at every youth event. This past summer, I journeyed to Israel on NFTY's L'Dor v'Dor program to examine my roots and solidify my goal of becoming a cantor. Seeing my ancestral homeland was the final step; I felt a visceral connection to all aspects of Judaism.

What my community has offered me, I want to give to others. To be able to bond with a diverse congregation, create a spiritual moment for those many years my senior or my peers, and inspire all of them through song and prayer is an incomparable sensation. I truly feel like I am participating in tikkun olam, or healing the world. Not many people have had their career planned out since age fifteen, but to me, being a cantor was the only path that combined my passions with my identity. I know that nothing else in life could give me the spiritual joy and fulfillment that I crave, while having a positive effect on others.

Leaving the temple parking lot, I am perfectly content. Just as on every other Friday night, I smile an inward smile and think to myself, ""Yeah, this really is what I want to do with my life. Good choice.""

"My summer job at Dunkin Donuts has taught me many things. After scooping more than 800 ice creams and making more than 1200 cups of coffee, I've become an expert at serving all our specialties really fast. The commuters running to catch their trains and the little league teams coming in for a treat after a game can count on me and my colleagues to fill their order quickly. But beyond the details of serving customers and maintaining the store, I've realized some very important truths about working people and hard economic realities. Maybe ""America Runs on Dunkin"" but Dunkin runs on the energy of low-paid, hard working people.

For example, my supervisor Alfredo, an immigrant from Mexico, works 2 shifts at two different Dunkin Donut stores. Although his English is limited, he showed great patience when training me and demonstrated tolerance and understanding whenever I made a mistake. Alfredo treats me with kindness and respect even though he is aware that my life is more comfortable and carefree than his. Alfredo tells me he works so hard to take care of his young daughter, and in the short time that I've known him, I have gained so much respect for his work ethic and his values. Many people fail to appreciate the hard work and effort that people like Alfredo exhibit for such inadequate pay.

My co-worker and new friend, Jackie, works 80 hours a week to support her 16 month old daughter. Jackie's only 20 years old, and has many expenses including rent, car payments, and a babysitter. Jackie counts on her overtime salary to make ends meet. I really admire Jackie because she's under so much pressure at home, and at work; yet she demonstrates optimism and keeps moving forward. I feel a little sheepish when I ask Jackie to let me leave work early to study for exams, because my stress seems so minor compared to all of her daily pressures. This experience has made me realize how lucky I am to be prioritizing my academic record because I am fortunate enough to be planning to attend college.

Right next door to Dunkin Donuts is a family owned bagel store, ""Bagel Emporium."" Every once in a while, the two owners come into our store and put a soccer game on our big screen TV. They are friendly to all of us even though, clearly, the Dunkin Donuts has taken away a lot of their business. This makes me understand why so many communities fight big name stores like WalMart because locally run business can't really compete with these giants. I've gained a total respect for working people and now I will always leave big tips wherever I can. I will also shop at a local establishments rather than a chain, despite the fact that I work for one now.

I hope that by studying business in college I can learn more about business and its social responsibility. I understand that capitalism provides a wonderful opportunity for businesses, yet I now have more questions about the injustices that can occur in the pursuit of profits. I vehemently believe that the lessons I've learned this summer have influenced my character and values, and will help me develop a better sense of business ethics as I pursue my career.www.cracksat.net

3. Improve the conclusion: Summarize the key lessons learned and tie them back to the author's future goals and aspirations. Consider ending with a thought-provoking statement or a call to action that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
4. Add depth and analysis: While the essay provides good insights and personal experiences, it would benefit from deeper analysis and reflection. Take the time to unpack the significance of the observed injustices and elaborate on the potential impact of studying business and exploring business ethics.
5. Revise for clarity and grammar: Proofread the essay carefully to ensure that it is free of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. Reword any sentences that are unclear or confusing to improve readability.

With these improvements, the essay has the potential to become a strong and impactful personal statement that highlights the author's character, values, and aspirations. Good luck!"
"Sometime between waking up at the crack of dawn and fourth period I became a teenage werewolf. No, wait, I mean feminist.

It's as if I didn't know until someone pointed it out to me in English class, but it was more like an ""Ooh, dude, I think you just stepped in some feminist,"" or a ""Damn! You smell like feminist,"" or maybe even an ""I think you spilled some feminism on your shirt, and it stains…""

I've been labeled many things throughout my life in Cleveland, Ohio, from preppy (but don't ever expect to see me in a collared shirt and khakis) to punk (maybe my new lip piercing and occasional green eyeliner add to this, but even for Cleveland, I'm about as punk as Marcia Brady) to slightly insane (a mix between MTV's hidden camera show Punk'd and starlet Nicole Richie)—I've even been told that I'm unique looking (why am I so sure it's not a compliment?) and maybe labeling me makes it easier to figure out who I am (hell—I don't even know!), but recently my whole class seems to have decided that I'm a bra-burning, men-hating Feminazi.

My English teacher, a minority-equalizing, feminist-loving, all around pro-everything-liberal kind of man, said that if a guy were to ever hold the door open for me, I would ""punch his lights out.""

I pictured myself through his eyes, toned and fuming hatred, simultaneously liberating the oppressed and crushing lanky teenage boys with my bare hands, their awkward limbs flinging in the air as I fought in honor of my fellow womyn.

Would I? I wondered. Maybe I would just thank him and walk through the door. Teenage boys displaying chivalry is not something I see every day, so I might pause. I might wonder, why this gesture of civility, right here, right now? But punch his lights out? I'm barely five feet tall—I aspire to meet the height requirements for amusement park rides, not to dominate all who cross my path.

But I should have seen it coming. After sharing with the group several weeks earlier that being whistled at in the hallways or told that I have a fine ass (or some other creative come-on) was about as flattering to me as being compared to Santa Claus (jolly, red, and round), it is only fitting—they finally discovered that I am the monster within their midst. It's as if I was biding my time at school until I could become a trophy wife for some successful businessman or an exotic dancer with breasts filled with more than my brain, and suddenly I've crushed their dreams by becoming this, this, this breathing, thinking, independent young woman!

I am not about to apologize for wanting to be seen as the lovechild of Mary Wollstonecraft and Justin Timberlake (smart, sexy, and awesome on the dance floor). And even if it angers them to hear I think so, my guess is I will be more financially and personally successful than most of the boys I know.

I know I'm a feminist, but I am also just a teenage girl trying to survive junior year (because everyone knows being in high school is almost as enjoyable as four years of paper cuts). I could be a Clark Kent feminist—you know the ones; coy and giggly when the boys are around, fierce all-grrrl when she's alone with her posse. I could be the kind who keeps Ms. hidden inside a copy of Seventeen on the bedside table, or I could go all-out old-school in ripped jeans and combat boots—but that's not me, either. I want to be who I am, big or small, editor-in-chief or head cheerleader, point guard or math geek, and I want to make it so that when my daughter goes to high school and says she's a feminist, everyone in the school, from the kids smoking in the parking lot to the principal, just yawns and says, yeah, who isn't?www.cracksat.net

"I was never really upset about it. I never resented my parents for it. I didn't ever feel unlucky because of it. My sister had Down Syndrome, and that was that. Sure, I found it a little odd that while most of my friends' big sisters secretly applied lipstick on the walk to school, mine collected worms, which she would make into jewelry. But except for the occasionally painful quarrel (one of which left a bite mark on my right shoulder) my sister and I got along. The only problem was, after a while it became difficult for me to think of Katie as my sister, a person whose flesh and blood were identical to mine. There were just too many things that separated us, and soon I became the older sister, the leader and decision maker. In grade school, I noticed that the gap between us was growing larger. I outgrew monkey bars, but Katie didn't. I stopped climbing trees, but Katie wouldn't. I learned to write poetry, but Katie couldn't. I stopped roller-skating and began diving; I stopped trick-or-treating and began dieting. I'm not sure if Katie ever understood why, and to be honest, I'm not sure if I understood either. By high school the gap between us had gotten huge, and I remember feeling more like Katie's parent than her sister. But then, one strange and snowy night, something beautiful happened.

It was the winter of my junior year. The sky was black and empty, and its breath ached inside warm lungs. Life, it seemed, had either burrowed itself underground for warmth or had gone south for the winter like my Uncle Sherman, who can't stand the cold. The trees were bare and lonely, and every once in a while they would point to a dimly lit, second-story window where my silhouette lay motionless on a bed. I was in one of those moods, those strange moods, where the world suddenly appears to be under water. Its sights and sounds majestically blur together, like some sort of half-dream. I felt uneasy and unfamiliar with myself and with everything around me. It's one of those states that comes occasionally in adolescence probably because of hormones, anxiety, and greasy foods all reacting with each other inside of our bodies. All I could do was lie on my bed. After I had counted something like three hundred of the tiny little dots on my ceiling, my sister entered my room. ""What now, Katie?"" I barked at her in my head, unable to make words come out of my mouth. I was anticipating her to begin her nightly ritual of describing, in exact detail, the events of her day: the food she's eaten, the friends she's talked to, the boys she might marry. But I stayed silent. I glanced in her direction to see if she was still there, and she was. She approached the foot of my bed and gently adjusted my feet to make room for herself. She sat down and stared at me for what must have been a long time. And then, as if she was aware of my inability to form words at that moment, she began to talk to me in sign language. (She had been learning it at school as part of some enrichment program.) I remembered only a few gestures that I had learned in elementary school, so she began teaching me. ""School."" ""Mom."" ""Boy."" ""Bathroom."" ""Stupid."" ""Sister."" ""I love you."" All of a sudden I realized that for the first time in nearly a decade, Katie was the older sister again. For the first time since we were kids, she was teaching me. And just like that, the gap disappeared. Just like that, we were sisters again. My emotionally masochistic fog quickly lifted and the world seemed clear to me again—clear but not perfect; not perfect, but adequate. I realized then what I should have known all along: that my sister and I, despite significant differences, will always be sisters; that she's taught me much more than I have ever given her credit for. And I'll always be grateful to her for the night when she taught me to say, ""Sister, I love you,"" in the only language that I could comprehend.www.cracksat.net

"Toddlers with buzz-cuts. Shirts tucked in. Shorts pulled high. Matching outfits chosen by Mommy. From the beginning, my brother and I have been incessantly competing with and compared to each other. Although Bryce is nearly two years older, adults frequently thought we were twins because we were about the same height and almost identical as young boys. While I no longer have to worry about people mistaking the two of us physically, I am still ensnared by the inescapable expectations and unbelievable pressure of being Bryce Taylor's younger brother.

Our competition, which consisted of underwater breath-holding contests and one-on-one basketball games, was once among the most memorable and pleasant aspects of my childhood. But as we matured and began replacing our pretend school sessions with AP classes and our play-room football contests with Friday night varsity games, the self-imposed struggle within my soul to match my brother's achievements began to escalate at an unhealthy rate.

Bryce was as close to a Greek god as anyone could be in high school. As starting running back on the football team, Bryce was one of the strongest weight-lifters on the team, one of the only players to start on varsity all four years of high school, and one of the key contributors on our school's first State Championship team his junior year. When he passed down his #10 jersey to me upon his graduation, it symbolized the demand for me to live up to his seemingly unattainable success as an athlete.

In the classroom, Bryce set an even higher standard than on the football field. Graduating as valedictorian of his class (I'm only salutatorian), scoring perfect 5's on all but one of his seven AP exams (I had only two 5's and one 3 after my junior year), and becoming a National Merit Finalist (I'm Commended), Bryce not only set a high bar, he set it as high as it could possibly go.

However, at graduation, I did notice his speech was dry and he looked uncomfortable speaking in front of an audience. Then it hit me—that boy is not perfect! He would rather be alone reading a book than surrounded by friends. Bryce refused to attend his senior float building (a social event for class bonding) until his classmates literally dragged him to the site. I am completely different, a ""people person"" who cannot spend enough time with friends and feels at ease when addressing a crowd.

Formerly, I viewed my brother's success as a burden on me to perform at an equally high level, which only led to unnecessary disappointment, stress, and anger. But after realizing the stupidity and futility of comparing myself to Bryce, I was finally able to celebrate his achievements and concentrate on making the most of my gifts without caring how they measure up to those of my brother. I learned to be comfortable with who I am. I meet my own expectations.

Bryce's dream to study at a prestigious university (Yale) was outside my scope a few years ago. He enlarged my reality, challenged me to transcend my comfort zone, and taught me to suppress my delusions of inadequacy. Because Bryce dared to aim for the unreachable and aspired to do great things, he set the ultimate example for me and taught me never to set a limit on myself or on my own dreams.

My brother's accomplishments now serve as a stimulus for me to do everything with passion and excellence, not as my definitive criterion for achievement. What many of my friends think is a curse—being Bryce Taylor's little brother—is actually an incomparable blessing. It has pushed me to soar above the mediocrity and apathy holding many teenagers back and to become a focused and relentless individual. The competitive spirit engendered within me as an over-achiever's brother forced me to excel when I didn't feel like it or thought I couldn't do it. In my case, sibling rivalry was not detrimental but served as a constructive force in my life.

I find it ironic that after all these years of looking up to my brother, he now must look up to me because I am a few inches taller. Oh, and by the way, my pants were never pulled up as high as Bryce's—I've always had more style.www.cracksat.net

"I should not have dressed up. Apparently, no other fifth grader had felt driven to celebrate the first day of school via fancy clothing, and so I stood out not just as a newcomer, but as an awkwardly dressed one. Scratching at grainy black tights with the toe of my sneaker, I paused uncertainly in the doorway of the Writing room.

Pausing uncertainly, however, was not the way of the world of Mr. Matthews. This red-haired, red-bearded, red-faced man beckoned wildly at me to enter. I scuttled over to a seat, and in three minutes of casual observation was convinced that I had never known an adult like him. He laughed from his belly, wiggled his ears on request, and then blushed an embarrassed shade redder. His students loved him; it was evident from the way they greeted him to the way they relaxed when they entered his room.

On the contrary, I was not relaxed. I was nervous, I was in a room full of strangers, and I was, at best, apathetic towards writing. My only previous writing experience had been in cloth-covered books with more room for illustrations than print. I had no idea what to expect from a class that was just called ""Writing,"" but I was certain I wasn't going to like it.

Yet Mr. M spent that first class entertaining us. He told stories, cracked jokes, and then dismissed us early for recess. Our assignment to write about the best part of summer seemed almost an afterthought for him.

Nevertheless, I was seized by an unprecedented and inexplicable desire to do my homework. It wasn't anything specific he had said in class that day, but the way he had acted. I wanted this crazy, charismatic, exuberant man to like and approve of me, and the quickest way to earn this was through my writing.

Tricky.

That night, despite having dealt with a word processor all of twice in my life, despite spending more time on this single homework assignment than any other night's combined, and despite an embarrassingly trite roller-coaster-ride topic, I wrote with fiery passion. Triumphantly handing it in the next morning, I was sure it was the best thing I'd ever written.

For the rest of the year, I worked to relive, again and again, that feeling of accomplishment. I challenged myself to write well, as much for myself as for Mr. M. This one-man audience inspired me to constantly strive to improve and impress, and in the process I discovered that I, shockingly, liked to write. The aforementioned, overdressed fifth grader would never have guessed that, six years later, writing would become a voluntary, daily activity, flowing from journals to emails to poetry workshops to newspapers.

Mr. M left our school at the end of that year. At his goodbye party, he thumped me on the shoulder and said, ""You've got a good head on your shoulders, kid. Use it well."" It was only in looking back that I realized this was the moment I had been waiting for all year.

Over time, Mr. M.'s approval and guidance has grown with me; it is my mantra to push myself further, to think before acting. He believed in me as a writer, and in some ways as a person, before I did, and these high expectations have carried me further than anything else could have. Today, I am still curious about what he saw in me, and I think I am still growing into the person he might have predicted. But I also still am, and always will be, striving to surprise him by becoming even more.www.cracksat.net

"Describe the environment in which you grew up and how it has shaped your personal goals.

I grew up in a brick house on Nottingham Drive, a place with old furniture and young faces, with small rooms that never seemed to be empty. I grew up with my pointy nose buried in books, wearing stretch pants and bows and listening to my father's new songs on the guitar. I sat at a dinner table as girlish voices made fun of that pointy nose along with my big ears, and I finally learned to laugh about them. I grew up with a big-nosed father who always had a joke on his tongue and a mother who always had an answer. I heard that as long as I worked hard enough, I could do anything.

I grew up eating fresh toma- toes from my grandpa's garden and later saw that same garden overrun with weeds. I grew up during summers at the lake, with cousins who couldn't read until fourth grade and could break every object in sight. I watched at a distance as relatives struggled through life, searching for paths to independence. I heard stories from the adults' fold-out table, of women abandoned by the men whom they had depended on. Somewhere amongst those stories, I made up my mind not to make their same mistakes.

I grew up with a determination to make something of myself, to stand apart from the crowd. I listened to seemingly endless stories about the Depression and wars and old friends. I wondered if I would ever get a chance to tell my stories. I wondered what type of stories I would have to tell.

I began to understand that I have a choice. I can choose the stories that I want to tell. I can choose whether or not I repeat others' mistakes. And I can choose what I make of myself. As to how I make these choices, I'm sure that all I have to do is remember the stories from when I grew up.www.cracksat.net

However, there are several areas where improvement can be made to make the essay more compelling and impactful.

Strengths:
1. The opening sentence of the essay is attention-grabbing and sets the stage for the description of the environment.
2. The vivid descriptions used to depict the setting, such as the ""brick house on Nottingham Drive"" and the ""old furniture and young faces,"" help to create a clear image in the reader's mind.
3. The use of personal anecdotes, such as listening to the father's songs on the guitar and eating fresh tomatoes from the grandpa's garden, adds depth and authenticity to the essay.

Areas of concern:
1. The essay lacks a clear focus or central theme. Although it mentions the environment and its influence on personal goals, it is not clear what specific goals the student has or how they were shaped by their upbringing. The essay should have a more cohesive structure and a clear message.
2. The essay could benefit from more reflection and analysis. Instead of simply listing anecdotes and experiences, the student should dig deeper into their thoughts and emotions regarding their upbringing and how it has shaped them. This will help create a more meaningful and insightful narrative.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Start the essay with a strong and specific thesis statement that clearly states the student's personal goals and how their environment has influenced them. This will provide a clear focus for the essay.
2. Expand on the specific experiences and moments that have shaped the student's goals. For example, instead of briefly mentioning the stories heard at the dinner table, provide specific examples and explain how they impacted the student's mindset.
3. Include more reflection and analysis throughout the essay. Instead of simply listing experiences, delve into the emotions, thoughts, and lessons learned from each experience. This will make the essay more personal and compelling.
4. Consider incorporating a narrative arc or structure to make the essay flow more smoothly. This could involve starting with a specific moment or anecdote, reflecting on its significance, and then connecting it to the larger theme of personal goals and the student's upbringing.

"I identify Laetitia by the tights scented with French perfume in my sock drawer, her ten-pound black boots, which still live in my closet, and her beautiful laugh I hear over the phone every so often. Laetitia lived with us as an exchange student in 1994, the year my youngest sister was born. She was the first and only big sister I have ever had. Laetitia got my room and I moved in with my sister. From my eightyear-old perspective, she towered over me; she was tall and beautiful, a French masterpiece. Laetitia taught me so much over the year she lived with us and has continued to do so till today. During Chanukah, as we lit the Menorah she began to cry—remembering her father who had recently passed away. She was the first ""adult"" I saw cry. Laetitia taught me what a baguette, chocolate mousse, and crepes were, and how amazing it was to listen to her converse in French over the phone. When Laetitia left, I moved back into my old room but there was a void; my family felt it too. So, four years later we visited Laetitia in France. Her family was so welcoming and generous, even if we didn't always understand each other. In 2000, we went again for her wedding, a French Jewish Sephardic wedding. Her culture and language may be vastly different from my own, yet the love and care we have for each other is the same. I believe her scent in my top sock drawer will linger forever.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 70/100

Strengths:
- The essay establishes a strong personal connection with Laetitia and highlights the impact she has had on the author's life.
- The use of descriptive language, such as ""French masterpiece"" and ""beautiful laugh,"" helps to create vivid imagery and engage the reader.
- The inclusion of specific anecdotes, like lighting the Menorah during Chanukah and visiting Laetitia's family in France, adds depth and authenticity to the essay.

Areas of Concern:
- While the personal connection with Laetitia is clear, the essay lacks a clear focus or central theme. It jumps between different moments and experiences without a cohesive thread to tie them together.
- The essay would benefit from a more explicit exploration of how the author's relationship with Laetitia has shaped their personal growth or influenced their perspective on the world. Without this deeper exploration, the essay feels surface-level and lacks impact.
- The writing style is somewhat informal and lacks sophistication. There are instances of repetitive phrasing and clichés, such as referring to Laetitia as a ""French masterpiece."" The essay would benefit from a more polished and mature writing style.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Establish a clear theme or message: Choose one aspect of the author's relationship with Laetitia that has had the most significant impact and explore it in-depth. This will provide focus and coherence to the essay.
2. Reflect on personal growth: Instead of simply recounting experiences with Laetitia, delve into how these experiences have shaped the author's values, beliefs, or goals. What specific lessons or insights have they gained?
3. Strengthen the writing style: Use more sophisticated language and sentence structures to enhance the overall polish of the essay. Avoid clichés and unnecessary repetition. Consider incorporating literary devices or figurative language to add depth and complexity to the writing.
4. Connect back to college admissions: While the personal connection with Laetitia is valuable, tie it back to the author's college aspirations and how their relationship with her has prepared them for success in higher education. This will make the essay more relevant within the context of a college application.

Overall, the essay has potential but needs refinement in terms of focus, writing style, and depth of reflection. Implementing these suggestions will help create a more impactful and memorable essay."
"""I do it for the joy it brings 'cause I'm a joyful girl. 'Cause the world owes us nothing, we owe each other the world.""—Ani Difranco (""Joyful Girl"")

In the fall of my junior year, my mother announced that she had signed us up for a mission trip to Bolivia for Christmas break. My first thought was, ""That's impossible! But I wanted a new computer and some new clothes. How will we ever get all the gifts down there? Our suitcases will be too heavy!"" I was careful not to say these selfish things out loud. We—my mother, my three older siblings, and I—would be working as volunteers at the Amistad Mission in Cochubamba, Bolivia, a city of over two million people that none of us had ever heard of. Were we really going to spend Christmas working in an orphanage in one of the poorest countries in the world? For weeks leading up to the trip, I worried about what I would do there.

The minute we arrived at Amistad (the Friendship Mission), my fears dissolved. The children must have heard the grumbling engine and grinding of the bus tires on the gravel road, for as the primitive bus turned the corner, I could see no fewer than fifty sets of luminous, brown eyes welcoming us. Immediately sprinting toward us, one little girl, Naomi, leapt into my arms and kissed my face before even saying, ""Hola!"" Never before have I felt so welcomed by anyone—and these were complete strangers! Excited by our arrival, the children directed us to the community center, really a basketball court, which had been decorated with a Nativity scene made of crumpled manila paper. Dressed in tomato-red traditional Bolivian skirts, the teenagers narrated the Christmas Pageant as the younger children performed. Small native children were dressed as Mary, Joseph, Jesus, the three Wise Men, and the shepherds. The smallest girls pranced in full white dresses with masks made of cotton balls to make them look like sheep. Having obviously rehearsed for a long time, they proudly serenaded us with Christmas carols in Spanish, their joyous enthusiasm unbridled.

One day, I noticed a boy named Marcelo with a strange-looking apparatus of red plastic, rubber bands, and metal covering his face. My first response was to feel sorry for him: surely he was ashamed of his deformity and the need to wear this weird gizmo. But he came strolling up to the community center without a worry in the world, and as I approached to comfort him, he unleashed a huge smile inviting me to come outside to play soccer with him and his friends. No one else seemed to notice or even care about the brace installed to fix Marcelo's cleft palate.

The mission residences included ten houses, ""casas,"" each housing a ""family"" of eight children, with a ""mamà"" and ""tìa"" as caretakers. One afternoon I was invited to Casa San Francisco to eat lunch with one of the ""familias."" As guest of honor, I sat at the head of the long table with ten children sitting along each side. Over the wailing of the babies and bickering of the teenagers, the ""tìas"" attempted to say grace. Next, they passed out plates of rice, each with cooked carrots, peas and a small piece of flavorless chicken. As I was served my plate, three-year old Maria spilled her apple juice all over my food. The ensuing silence told me that they expected me to be upset. Knowing not enough food was left in the pot to replenish my plate, Eduardo, the eldest boy, gallantly offered me his. When I refused, he switched the plates anyway. During my weeklong stay, I noticed acts of generosity and kindness both large and small. These people had few material possessions to give, but during my week there, I received gifts beyond the tangible and became very attached to all of the children at the Mission.

Working hard from sunup to sundown was not exactly my original idea of how to spend my coveted Christmas holiday, but the week I spent working side by side with my family remains one of the best experiences of my life. We arranged activities for the kids—arts and crafts, trips to the park, and sports games. On Christmas day, when we helped the Amistad children host a fun-filled party for families living in dire conditions just beyond the Mission fence, our guests were overjoyed. The faces of both parents and children lit up as I handed each of them one simple present; filled with an appreciation for such simple things, these children deserved so much more, yet they were happy with what they had.

Not until several weeks after our return did I realize, ""Hey, I didn't get that computer I had wanted so much, nor the new jeans."" At the same time, I realized that I might have missed it all had I not gone on our Bolivia trip. The gifts I received last December from the orphaned children of Amistad added not a single pound to the luggage I carried home, for the lasting gifts they gave me were those of joy, of friendship, of growing up.www.cracksat.net

Overall, this essay does a decent job of showcasing the student's experience on a mission trip to Bolivia. The writer effectively presents the contrast between their initial selfish concerns and their eventual realization of the joy and fulfillment that comes from serving others. The essay also incorporates specific details and anecdotes that help bring the experience to life for the reader.

Strengths:
- Captivating opening: The essay begins with a strong hook, immediately capturing the reader's attention and inviting them to continue reading.
- Evocative language: The writer uses vivid language and sensory details to paint a picture of the sights, sounds, and emotions of the mission trip.
- Personal reflection: The writer demonstrates personal growth and self-awareness, recognizing their initial selfishness and how their perspective shifted after the trip.

Areas of Concern:
- Lack of structure: The essay lacks a clear structure or organization, which causes the narrative to feel disjointed at times. Consider structuring the essay around key moments or themes to provide a more coherent flow.
- Underdeveloped analysis: While the writer shares their experiences, there is limited analysis or reflection on the impact of these experiences. Dig deeper into your emotions, thoughts, and the lessons you gained from the trip.
- Limited focus on the writer: The essay primarily focuses on the experiences of others rather than the writer. Find ways to interweave more about yourself and your personal journey throughout the narrative.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the introduction: While the opening quote is intriguing, it would be beneficial to provide more context and relevance to the essay. Consider offering a brief explanation of Ani Difranco's quote and how it relates to your personal story.
2. Create a clear structure: Organize your essay in a way that leads the reader through your experience on the mission trip. Consider breaking the essay into sections based on key moments or themes, such as the initial doubts, the welcoming children, and the acts of generosity.
3. Provide deeper reflection: Rather than simply describing the events, take time to analyze the impact of these experiences on your values, beliefs, and worldview. How did your perspective shift? What lessons did you learn about gratitude, empathy, or service? Connect your personal growth to the broader themes of the essay.
4. Inject more of yourself: While it's important to showcase the experiences of others, remember that the essay is ultimately about you. Integrate more of your own thoughts, emotions, and reactions into the narrative to give the reader insight into your personal journey.
5. Show, don't tell: Instead of simply stating that the children were happy with what they had, demonstrate this through specific details and dialogue. Use descriptive language to bring these moments to life and truly engage the reader.

Rating: 70/100

Overall, this essay has potential but could benefit from more careful organization, deeper reflection, and a stronger focus on the writer's personal experience. With some revisions and additional development, this could become a strong, memorable essay that showcases the student's growth and demonstrates their fit for the college they are applying to."
"""Hey, Nickelback, I know that band. You like them?"" I ask, leaning over Chipu's shoulder to look at the stickers and pictures she has all over the front matter of her binder.

""Yeah,"" she looks up at me with her big brown eyes and smiles, clearly as relieved as I am to find something in common. It's my first day tutoring at Webster Middle School. I'm working with Team Prime Time, an organization that provides a place for children to go after school where their parents can pick them up after work. It is housed in a large, dimly lit classroom, where tables are arranged in haphazard circles around the room. Students are spread out, either in small groups or alone, around the tables, backpacks thrown down next to them, hunched over homework sheets or sharing textbooks. The linoleum floors in the big room make every whisper echo, so with twenty-five students trying to avoid doing their homework at the same time, quiet moments are few and far between.

""Oh that's cool,"" I say. ""I listen to Nickelback all the time. What's your favorite song?"" The conversation moves haltingly on from there as we both become more comfortable. Who knew it could be this hard to introduce myself to a ten-year-old? When I walked into Team Prime Time, I had no idea what to expect. I had not tutored young kids before, but I assumed there couldn't be much that I wouldn't be able to explain to a sixth grader. I later realized just how wrong that assumption had been. The coordinator, Mark, helped me get started by pointing out Chipu, a small, shy-looking girl with curly, dark hark hair tamed into braids, peeking out of a navy-blue hooded sweatshirt.

I walked over as she was doing her math homework. Actually, she had her book open to the correct page and was staring at her math homework (oh how well I know that feeling). ""Hi, I'm Lauren,"" I said, as I discovered that 'I'm here to tutor you' can be an awkward idea to try and convey in a first conversation. After chatting about music for a bit, we got to work.

""So...what is your assignment?""

Chipu pointed to the required problems on the page. There were faded pencil check marks in the margin next to them from a former student who evidently had done the same assignment. Looking down at the page I quickly read the problem.

""Okay, it looks like they're asking you to find which of these numbers in the list is a prime number,"" I said. ""Right,"" I immediately thought to myself, ""read the directions back to her; clearly that's not the problem."" Luckily for me, she let it slide.

""So,"" my valiant second attempt began, ""did your teacher go over how to do anything like this in class?""

Chipu shook her head.

""Okay, well a prime number is a number whose only factors are one and itself,"" I said. She looked at me blankly. ""Does that make sense?"" She shook her head no.

""Do you know what a factor is?""

""No,"" she answered simply.

""Oh, okay. Well a factor is a number that divides evenly into another number with nothing left over. So let's try 4. 2 is a factor of 4 because it goes into 4 exactly twice with nothing left over, see?""

""Sure,"" she said, nodding.

""So a prime number is a number like 5 where only the numbers that are factors are 1 and itself, 5.""

She nodded.

""So is 6 a prime number?""

""Yes,"" she said decisively.

""Are you sure?""

""No,"" she responded. Clearly if yes made me second guess her response then no must be the correct answer. I remember so clearly using that trick when I was younger. I tried to explain it a different way to little Chipu but received a similar response. Clearly the concept of prime numbers was a bit beyond the Chipu-Lauren team, so back to factoring for now.

""So those factor things. Do you know how to find them?""

""No,"" she shook her head emphatically.

""Okay, you divide the number whose factors you want to find by the numbers below it and see if they go in evenly with no remainder. So if you have the number 8, you divide it by 1, then by two..."" Eventually we made it all the way up to 8 this way. ""So, 1, 2, 4, and 8 are factors of 8, see?""

Chipu nodded seriously. During the following pause we looked at each other and I realized my teaching skills were going to take a lot more practice before I made much sense to listen to.

""That didn't make any sense at all did it,"" I asked her.

""Nope,"" she responds honestly.

""Okay, let's try again,"" I said, trying to think of a better way to explain something so abstract and wondering how I had ever been able to grasp it.

By the end of ""homework time,"" although we hadn't quite finished the math homework, she'd managed to get enough of a grasp of factoring, so she knew how to do the assignment. I, on the other hand, found myself a good deal humbled with a new ten-year-old friend who has great music taste.","Essay Score: 70

"""I don't do throw-up.""

My own words were coming back to haunt me as I heard one of my campers yell, ""Ewww, Bridger threw up."" I froze. I forced myself to turn around and look. I glanced quickly, then immediately looked away. I stopped breathing through my nose so I wouldn't be able to smell it. I was horrified.

The one thing that I hate most is throw-up. Looking at it causes me to gag. Earlier that week I had been talking to my friend, Molly, who was a counselor in Cabin 3. She was telling me how she had had to clean up her camper's vomit.

""I would never be able to do that,"" I said.

""Well I didn't have a choice,"" Molly replied.

""I just…I don't do throw-up,"" I retorted.

Working at Camp Seafarer on the ""Crystal Coast"" of North Carolina for the summer was like a dream to me. I had gone there as a camper, and my experiences there have influenced my life greatly. The counselors were so supportive, and it seemed like they never ran out of energy. I was excited to have the opportunity to affect someone's life the way my counselors had affected mine. Being a counselor, though, was more work than I had anticipated. I was always exhausted, and it was hard to keep giving 100 percent of myself twenty-four hours a day. In the end, however, it was worth staying up with a homesick camper or saying a longer goodnight to the shyest girl to help bring her out of her shell. It was just so much responsibility trying to keep twelve ten-year-olds safe, while trying to help them have a great summer. Now my responsibility was spreading to the one thing I dreaded most, cleaning up throw-up.

I looked around at Bridger who looked like she was either laughing or crying. I assumed she was crying since she had just gotten sick. Then I noticed my co-counselors, Jessie and Liz, standing around. I looked at them, waiting for them to take the initiative and start to clean up. But they didn't even move towards it. Then Jessie made a move.

""I'll take Bridger to the health center,"" she said

Darn, I thought, I should have volunteered to do that. I glanced at Liz.

""Sarah, I'm busy. Why don't you clean it up?""

I couldn't believe it! I was stuck with doing the one thing I have always said I would never do. All right, I can do this, I said to myself. What to get first?…Paper towels! I went into the bathroom to find some, but we were out. Okay, it's going to be okay. I'll just go to the cabin next door. I got some paper towels from Cabin 9 and hurried back to my cabin. As I approached my enemy, the throw-up, I noticed a lot of girls were crowded around me laughing.

""This is not funny girls, Bridger's sick,"" I told them and they backed up, still giggling softly. All right here goes nothing, I thought as I started to fling paper towels down on top of the vomit. I then squeezed my eyes shut and went in for the kill, picking up the mess. I picked up the paper towels as fast as I could and threw them into the trashcan. I had done it! I can handle this job; the late nights, exhausting days and all the puke that comes with it, I celebrated. Then I noticed that now the whole cabin was laughing.

""Sarah!"" Bridger exclaimed, ""The throw-up was fake!""

I learned, that summer, that with responsibility comes great rewards, such as my campers' hysterical laughing over the fake throw up. Every smile and every hug made the draining job worth it.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 60

Strengths:
- The essay effectively hooks the reader with a specific anecdote about the fear of throw-up.
- The writer portrays their growth and resilience as a camp counselor, emphasizing the rewarding moments.
- The essay is well-organized, following a clear narrative arc.

Areas of Concern:
1. Lack of Depth: While the essay presents an interesting situation, it lacks depth and meaningful reflection. The writer briefly mentions how being a camp counselor was more work than anticipated, but does not delve into the emotional or personal growth that occurred as a result.

2. Lack of Connection to Future Goals: The essay fails to connect the experience at Camp Seafarer to the writer's future goals or aspirations. It would strengthen the essay to mention how this experience shaped their desire to pursue a career path related to mentoring or teaching.

3. Limited Content: The essay is quite short and lacks additional details or examples to support the writer's main points. This leaves the reader with an incomplete understanding of the writer's experiences and personal development.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Go Beyond Surface-Level Reflection: The writer should spend more time reflecting on the challenges, rewards, and personal growth experienced during their time as a camp counselor. This can involve discussing specific instances where they faced obstacles, how they overcame them, and the impact these experiences had on their character and worldview.

2. Make Clear Connections: The writer needs to establish a stronger connection between their camp counselor experience and their future goals or aspirations. This can be achieved by discussing how their time at Camp Seafarer influenced their desire to pursue a specific field of study or career path.

3. Expand and Elaborate: The essay could benefit from additional details and examples to provide a richer, more nuanced understanding of the writer's experiences. This can include providing specific anecdotes, conversations with campers, or additional challenges overcome.

4. Check Spelling and Grammar: There are a few minor spelling and grammar errors throughout the essay. The writer should carefully proofread the essay to ensure readability and professionalism.

In conclusion, while the essay captures the reader's attention with an engaging anecdote, it lacks depth, fails to make meaningful connections, and provides limited content. By addressing these areas of concern and implementing the suggested improvements, the writer can significantly enhance the impact and effectiveness of their personal statement."
"At the age of four, I first learned how to play chess. Little did I know, my beginnings with the game would lead me down a lifelong path of defeat and discovery. Two years later, I lost every game at the Oregon State Chess Championship. Filled with self-pity from my result, I begged my mother to let me quit. 

Then I got lucky. After barraging him for months, my mother convinced Mr. Carl Haessler, a chess grandmaster, to tutor me in chess. After acquainting me with basic principles, Mr. Haessler taught me that chess is a problem-solving exercise. I had to examine the pieces, forces, and nuances in each position. I had to guide myself through questions such as: “what do you hope to achieve,” “what steps must you take to achieve that goal,” “what opposition do you have to account for.” These questions would help me arrive at an idea, construct a plan to implement the idea, then find moves which fit the plan. The next year in chess, I went from worst to first. However in 2015, my cognitive development plateaued due to changes outside my control. Within a year, I started 6th grade at a new school; my last sibling left home; my grandfather died; my father was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Most of my role models were either dead, leaving, or potentially dying. Intellectually, I could not comprehend the purpose of my pain or mitigate my nihilism. I grew reclusive and shy. I loathed life, school, and friends. 

Then I got lucky. In 2016 after encouragement from a classmate, I joined my school’s track team. I fell in love with running. I loved flying through forests, breathing in the air and hearing the birds. The track did not care that I felt broken, so I stopped feeling broken. Running rejuvenated my confidence in life, propelling me through middle school until my acceptance at Jesuit High School. Attending Jesuit, I realized being average was not enough; every student was athletic, tall, attractive and intelligent. Feeling the need to compete with my peers at Jesuit, I applied for the Beaverton, Oregon Mayor’s Youth Advisory Board (MYAB) and was nominated as a board member in September of 2019. Trying to balance MYAB, chess, and running, my grades started to slip. I chose to abandon running in order to continue my other extracurriculars. In the pursuit of competition, I lost what I loved; running was my escape and my community. Without it, I felt lonely, burned out and my self-esteem was shaken. 

 Then I got lucky. While studying for the SAT, I stumbled upon a passage authored in the 1800s by Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine debating the relationship between government and the governed. My mind began to re-open as I continued reading related works. I learned to appreciate and curiously examine complex thought without prejudice. I used my mind to explore broadly, understand deeply, and apply practically. My newfound intellectual fortitude was put to the test in the spring of 2021. MYAB was finalizing a document proposing defunding of the police to the Beaverton City Council. Of twenty board members, I was the only dissenting voice because MYAB had no tangible plan for the defunding or empiricism to support the policy. When unable to win the argument on its merits, other board members belittled me and attacked my views. Nonetheless, I stood firm in my convictions and the board eventually conceded the issue by scrapping the document. 

Through exploration with mind, body, and community, I realized that self worth is not determined solely by achievement or ability but also by internal conviction. No matter how many chess matches, races, or debates are won, what you stand for, what you believe; that is what differentiates us as humans. That's what motivates me: the incessant pursuit to sharpen my beliefs and apply them to move myself and society forward.","Essay Critique:

Overall, this essay showcases the transformative power of personal experiences and the growth that can result from them. The author effectively conveys a sense of resilience and self-discovery through their journey with chess, running, intellectual exploration, and activism. There is a clear theme of overcoming challenges and finding purpose throughout the essay.

Strengths:
1. Engaging Narrative: The author's storytelling ability is commendable. They effectively grab the reader's attention from the start by discussing their initial struggles with chess and build a compelling narrative of growth and self-discovery through various experiences.
2. Demonstrated Resilience: The author demonstrates resilience in the face of adversity, such as losing every game at a chess championship and experiencing personal and familial hardships. This resilience is further highlighted through their involvement in running, activism, and standing firm in their convictions.
3. Depth of Reflection: The essay delves into the author's internal thought processes and the emotional impact of their experiences. They reflect on their feelings of self-pity, nihilism, and loneliness, providing a deeper understanding of their personal development.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of Focus: While the essay covers various themes and experiences, there is a lack of clear focus or central argument. The transitions between different topics, such as chess, running, and activism, could be smoother, and there needs to be a stronger connection between each experience and its impact on the author's personal growth.
2. Over-reliance on Luck: The recurring theme of ""getting lucky"" may undermine the author's journey and personal agency. It would be more effective to highlight their persistence, resourcefulness, and initiative in seeking out opportunities instead.
3. Superficial Treatment of Certain Experiences: Some experiences, such as the loss of family members and the impact of abandoning running, are mentioned briefly but not explored in depth. These significant events could be given more attention to develop a richer narrative.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the Central Theme: The essay could benefit from a clearer central theme or argument, tying together the author's diverse experiences. This will help create a more cohesive and focused narrative.
2. Strengthen Transitions: Work on creating smoother transitions between different experiences, highlighting the connections and impact each one had on the author's personal growth. This will help improve the flow of the essay.
3. Deepen Reflection: Take the time to delve deeper into the emotional impact of the various experiences mentioned, particularly those involving personal loss and abandoning running. This will add depth and resonance to the essay.
4. Show Agency: Instead of emphasizing luck, highlight the actions the author took and the characteristics they possess that led to their personal growth. Emphasize persistence, initiative, and determination rather than relying on external factors.
5. Provide Concrete Examples: When discussing the author's growth through intellectual exploration and activism, provide specific examples of how their beliefs and convictions were shaped. This will add credibility and support to their claims.

Rating: 73/100

While the essay showcases some compelling moments and personal growth, there is room for improvement in terms of focus, depth, and articulation of the author's agency. With some refinements and a clearer central theme, this essay has potential to make a lasting impact on admissions officers."
"There's a slender volume on the top shelf of my bookcase, nestled snugly in between Midnight's Children and The Sun Also Rises. Given a cursory glance, there's nothing extraordinary about this book—a stylized peacock in green, orange and black is the sole embellishment on a plain white dust jacket. A title and author are printed on top of the image: Musings of Bygone Days, by Hari Hara Das.

If you were to tug the book from its spot on the shelf, meaning to flip idly through the crisp, still-white pages, you would learn two new things about it. The first is that apart from the title, this book is not written in English. The contents are typeset in a peculiar language, full of swooping, curvaceous characters that intertwine sinuously on each page.

You would also see a dedication, located prominently on the inside cover. It's in black ink, written in a bold, flourishing hand. ""Presented with love to my dearest Sibjeet. Hari Hara Das, 28 July, 2003.""

Hari Hara Das is my maternal grandfather. He has written over fifteen books—five novels and novellas, four short story anthologies, several collections of poetry. My mother tells me that for twenty-eight years, he taught university students how to wield a pen with grace, and power, and restraint. He is an author in every sense of the word.

Every novel, story, and poem my grandfather has written is in Oriya. It's an Indo-Aryan language, rooted in Sanskrit, comprised of swooping, curvaceous characters that intertwine sinuously on each page.

I can't read a word of it.

My mother tried to teach me—throughout elementary school, not a summer went by in which she didn't try to entice me to sit down with a ragged Oriya preschool primer. But I was younger then, and didn't think that learning a strange alphabet was important enough to keep me from the street hockey games that were going on without me as I chafed under my mother's lessons.

*****

When I was twelve years old, my grandfather gave me Musings of Bygone Days on the last day of one of our biannual trips to India. We had stayed in his house for only a week, and though I was happy to spend time with him, I was more eager to play badminton and tease stray cats and plan pranks on my grandmother, abetted by similarly-impish cousins.

The morning of my departure, he pulled me aside and handed me the book. It wasn't wrapped, and I was thrilled to see his name on the cover.

""Is this one of the books you wrote, Grandfather?"" I blurted excitedly.

""Indeed it is,"" he replied in his booming, professorial voice. ""It's a collection of poetry.""

Eagerly, I flipped through the first few pages—and stopped. Crestfallen, I turned to him, and had the grace to look embarrassed. ""Grandfather, this is in Oriya. I can't read it.""

I began to hand it back to him, but he smiled and shook his head.

""That's not the point at all. Someday, I hope you will be able to read this. Until then, please keep it, and fill in the words yourself.""

*****

So I keep the book on the top shelf of my bookcase. Take it down, from time to time. Trace the characters with my fingers, marveling at their smoothness, wondering what they might say. I like to think I'll find out someday.

In the meantime, I tell my own stories, pen my own poems, compose essays and articles and critiques, just as he did for his entire life.

I layer my words over his, and the English blurs with Oriya when I write.www.cracksat.net

"""Ha ha! Christina is a dirty Mexican!""

Growing up in a small, conservative community, it's easy to be shoved into your own category if you don't look or act like everyone else. My hair and eyes, instead of being blonde and blue like all of my Czech classmates, were chocolate and espresso. My last name had a ""z"" in it, and my grandmother called me ""mija."" By the time I was in grade school, the teasing began, and I was hurt and confused. Didn't all grandmothers call their grandchildren ""mija""? Why did everyone except for me have blue eyes? And why was I being called ""dirty Mexican"" when I was cleaner than the boy who made the remark?

After an afternoon of teasing and tormenting from my classmates, I asked these questions to my mother, between sobs. By this time, she had become extremely good at giving me the ""you're unique and beautiful"" speech, but it was hard for her to truly empathize with me because neither she nor my father knew how I felt. She was a Caucasian who grew up in California; he was a Mexican American who grew up as the majority in San Antonio. I was the product of the two—the ""half-breed"" daughter who was raised in the small town of Seymour, population 2,800.

My other family members didn't seem to have any trouble fitting in. My father's ethnicity is well respected. He is the only doctor within a fifty-mile radius who can speak Spanish. My sister was the beauty queen of our town—her sleek, glossy hair and olive complexion were the envy of every girl. My little brother received the recessive genes (fair skin, blue eyes), so he looks like everyone else in Seymour. I felt I was stuck somewhere in the middle of my siblings, stuck in the middle of two cultures, and not accepted by either.

Time does have a way of healing things. I didn't just wake up one morning and think, ""I'm proud to be Hispanic,"" but as I have matured, I have learned not to be ashamed of my ethnicity. Instead of hiding who I really am, I have embraced my Mexican heritage and have become proud of it. Finding out about the many opportunities that are available to students of Hispanic descent has motivated me even more to delve deeper into my culture.

Looking back, I couldn't imagine wanting to dye my hair blonde to feel better about myself. The blonde girls are unique in their own way, but diversity makes the world go round. I absolutely love being different and not walking the same path as everyone else. The last racist comment I received was after I was named a National Hispanic Scholar. My assailant said in a mocking tone, ""I wish I could be a smart Mexican."" Feeling sorry for his cultural ignorance, I smiled and replied, ""Yeah, I bet you do.""

5. Consider revisiting the conclusion to leave a lasting impact on the reader. You can offer a thought-provoking reflection or emphasize the importance of embracing diversity and promoting cultural understanding.

Remember, your personal statement should not be solely about your experiences, but also about your growth, aspirations, and how you will contribute to the college community. Use this essay as an opportunity to showcase your unique perspective and passion for learning. Good luck!"
"I've been raised in a somewhat sheltered environment, mostly surrounded by wealthy, white kids. Often, I pondered whether or not I was materialistic or blatantly ignorant of my good fortune much like many of my peers. Transferring from a rather small, Catholic school in Rock Hill, I noticed the different mannerisms—spoiled nature and flaunting of wealth—that a majority of the students possessed and I thought little of it because I was so young and na?ve. As I started to mature, a fear sparked within me like the strike of a matchstick, fear that I was being unduly influenced and would develop the characteristics of some of my more sheltered and spoiled classmates. That is not who I wanted to become.

A couple of years ago, a black student named James came to my school, and we quickly became acquaintances. He has wielded such a positive impact on my life as no other single person could have done. Born in Queens, New York, he was the only child in his family, including his extended family, who was not born in Africa. He went to a boarding school in Nigeria, where his dad went through schooling, and moved to Charlotte with his dad, stepmom, and brother.

Before I met James, I had never experienced such a tight bond and strong friendship with a person of African descent. As our relationship blossomed, I was hit head on by a different world. For example, the first time I ventured over to his house, it affected me and altered the way I perceive certain things every day. As I stepped out of my car, I noticed the paint chipped away on the fa?ade of his house and the metal bars in front of his windows. The furniture in his house was torn and antique-looking; some masked in tape in order to hold it together. My nostrils filled with the smell of home cooking as I entered a kitchen and dining room that could barely fit a family of four. James introduced me to his dad, who greeted me with a strong handshake and a thick Nigerian accent. His poverty-stricken family didn't enjoy all the luxuries that most of my friends and I enjoyed; yet, they were content with the little they had and not once did I ever hear James complain of his misfortune. He would always and still does call me for rides because his family can't afford to buy him a car. One spring, James went to the beach with my family and me. As we were running to shake off the restlessness of the long car ride, James turned towards the beach and stopped. He stared as the spectacle in awe and told me he had never seen the beach before.

I asked James about the discrimination he faces every day, and he shared with me numerous situations that opened my eyes to what he, and many other African Americans, go through each day. I invited him into my life and conversed with him about my white southern background and my Scottish descent. One day, James thanked me for caring enough to befriend him and make an effort to understand his situation and where he is coming from. Thus, our worlds collided by integrating in a spirit of harmony and trust. Barriers were broken. James bestowed upon me a gift that no other friend I had was capable of giving. He taught me to be thankful and grateful for my parents' hard work and for what they have given me. He showed me various ways to look at things from other perspectives and not conform to the common racial stereotypes. Most importantly, he indirectly showed me how I could become a better person by crossing different boundaries and getting to know people who aren't like me, and experiencing new situations. I hope to continue to use this wonderful gift at Duke and in my life after college. I will be forever thankful for the contributions James has made, and this gift will never be forgotten.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 72/100

Strengths:
- The essay starts with a captivating introduction that grabs the reader's attention and sets up the central theme of personal growth and the desire to avoid negative influences.
- The author effectively uses personal anecdotes and specific details to illustrate their experiences and the impact of their friendship with James.
- The essay highlights the author's genuine desire to understand different perspectives and break down racial stereotypes.
- The conclusion effectively emphasizes the lasting impact of the friendship with James and the desire to continue growing as a person.

Areas of Concern:
- The essay lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow the flow of the narrative. Consider organizing the essay by chronological order or thematic elements to create a more coherent structure.
- The essay could benefit from more reflection and introspection. While the author mentions being influenced by James, there is limited exploration of their own personal growth and development as a result of the friendship. Consider delving deeper into the transformative moments and how they shaped the author's values and beliefs.
- The essay occasionally veers into generalizations, such as assuming all wealthy, white kids are materialistic or sheltered. Be cautious of making sweeping statements and focus on personal experiences and observations.
- Some parts of the essay lack clarity and could be more concise. Consider revising and tightening sentences to improve readability and eliminate unnecessary repetition.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Structure: Rearrange the essay in a more logical and organized manner. Consider starting with the initial encounter with James and then proceed chronologically to describe how the friendship evolved and the impact it had on the author.
2. Reflection: Take more time to reflect on the personal growth and introspection that occurred as a result of the friendship with James. Explore the moments when you challenged your own assumptions and how your perspective shifted. This will add depth and insight to the narrative.
3. Focus on personal experiences: Instead of making broad generalizations about ""wealthy, white kids"" or assuming the experiences of African Americans, focus on your personal observations and interactions. Share more specific stories or conversations that highlight the lessons learned.
4. Conciseness: Review the essay for wordiness and repetitive phrasing. Shorten sentences and eliminate unnecessary details or repetitive information to improve clarity and readability.

Overall, this essay has potential but requires more structure, reflection, and focus on personal experiences. By enhancing these aspects, the essay can become a more compelling and memorable narrative."
"I stood still, facing the giant bathroom mirror. Whoosh. The bathroom door swung open, and a group of girls came in, chatting and laughing. I stared into the mirror. A blonde, clearly more than a head taller than I, strolled past, reaching for the paper towel dispenser. Another stocky redhead briskly walked into the stall right behind me. The two different hair colors contrasted sharply with my own under the fluorescent lights. We were all wearing the same cardigan sweater, the same blue plaid skirt, and the same brown leather shoes. My uniform was impeccable, as I had been interviewed by a newspaper not fifteen minutes before. The girl that stared back at me from the mirror was short and skinny. She had a long face with dark brown eyes, black hair, and a big forehead. She was a red belt in Tae Kwon Do; she was a co-captain of Robotics; she was the founder of the school's American Mathematical Competition team. But she was also an international student.

""When can I stop being an international student?"" I asked myself exasperatedly. My memory flashed to the interview. A reporter came in and asked me some questions for the local newspaper after I had just been announced as a National Merit Semifinalist. I remembered how she asked me what it felt like to be a semifinalist. I said I was surprised and excited. I smiled a lot and said the things a good student was supposed to say, but what I neglected to mention was that I did not qualify to be a finalist because I lacked the proper immigration documents.

But I did not lack anything else. Were my other qualifications not good enough?

In the back of my head I remembered my first step onto the land of the United States at the age of twelve. I remembered how thrilled I was to be able to listen and finally understand a casual conversation in English; I remembered my American counterparts' excitement when they learned how to say some basic expressions in Chinese; I remembered how we traded stories of growing up on opposite sides of the globe. We laughed at each other's strange accents and customs; we learned from each other's experiences.

My mind wandered farther and farther back down memory lane to China as I stood still. It was as if I could still see my cousins and myself through the mirror, running around wildly while our blindfolded grandfather, with his hands grabbing the air and his back stooped, tried to catch us. Memories of grandpa brought warmth into my heart. I smiled, knowing that a part of him has been passed down to me; and, though he was no longer of this world, he would see through my dark-brown eyes and feel through my youthful hands.

Whoosh. The door swung open again, and the two girls walked out, still talking and laughing. I took a deep breath and decided that it was time for me to go. I ambled out and saw a beautiful sunny autumn afternoon through the window. One of my friends ran up to me, patted my shoulder, and cheerfully said, ""C'mon, let's go do some homework and chat outside."" ""Sure,"" I said as I grinned back. ""Hey! Let's see who can get there first!"" She ran past me playfully, leaving behind her a trail of laughter. ""Wait!"" I yelled after her as I hurried to catch up: ""Don't forget we still need to figure out that one calc problem!""

When I finally sat down on the cool green grass and squinted at the radiant sun, my heart was content. ""I don't lack anything,"" I thought. ""I don't need any man-made rules to qualify me. This is me. The complete me is right here, right now, basking under the glory of the sun. And that is good enough.""www.cracksat.net

"""I don't do throw-up.""

My own words were coming back to haunt me as I heard one of my campers yell, ""Ewww, Bridger threw up."" I froze. I forced myself to turn around and look. I glanced quickly, then immediately looked away. I stopped breathing through my nose so I wouldn't be able to smell it. I was horrified.

The one thing that I hate most is throw-up. Looking at it causes me to gag. Earlier that week I had been talking to my friend, Molly, who was a counselor in Cabin 3. She was telling me how she had had to clean up her camper's vomit.

""I would never be able to do that,"" I said.

""Well I didn't have a choice,"" Molly replied.

""I just…I don't do throw-up,"" I retorted.

Working at Camp Seafarer on the ""Crystal Coast"" of North Carolina for the summer was like a dream to me. I had gone there as a camper, and my experiences there have influenced my life greatly. The counselors were so supportive, and it seemed like they never ran out of energy. I was excited to have the opportunity to affect someone's life the way my counselors had affected mine. Being a counselor, though, was more work than I had anticipated. I was always exhausted, and it was hard to keep giving 100 percent of myself twenty-four hours a day. In the end, however, it was worth staying up with a homesick camper or saying a longer goodnight to the shyest girl to help bring her out of her shell. It was just so much responsibility trying to keep twelve ten-year-olds safe, while trying to help them have a great summer. Now my responsibility was spreading to the one thing I dreaded most, cleaning up throw-up.

I looked around at Bridger who looked like she was either laughing or crying. I assumed she was crying since she had just gotten sick. Then I noticed my co-counselors, Jessie and Liz, standing around. I looked at them, waiting for them to take the initiative and start to clean up. But they didn't even move towards it. Then Jessie made a move.

""I'll take Bridger to the health center,"" she said

Darn, I thought, I should have volunteered to do that. I glanced at Liz.

""Sarah, I'm busy. Why don't you clean it up?""

I couldn't believe it! I was stuck with doing the one thing I have always said I would never do. All right, I can do this, I said to myself. What to get first?…Paper towels! I went into the bathroom to find some, but we were out. Okay, it's going to be okay. I'll just go to the cabin next door. I got some paper towels from Cabin 9 and hurried back to my cabin. As I approached my enemy, the throw-up, I noticed a lot of girls were crowded around me laughing.

""This is not funny girls, Bridger's sick,"" I told them and they backed up, still giggling softly. All right here goes nothing, I thought as I started to fling paper towels down on top of the vomit. I then squeezed my eyes shut and went in for the kill, picking up the mess. I picked up the paper towels as fast as I could and threw them into the trashcan. I had done it! I can handle this job; the late nights, exhausting days and all the puke that comes with it, I celebrated. Then I noticed that now the whole cabin was laughing.

""Sarah!"" Bridger exclaimed, ""The throw-up was fake!""

I learned, that summer, that with responsibility comes great rewards, such as my campers' hysterical laughing over the fake throw up. Every smile and every hug made the draining job worth it.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 70/100

Strengths:
- The essay effectively captures a specific moment and experience in the writer's life, showcasing their personal growth and ability to overcome a challenge.
- The writer demonstrates a sense of self-awareness and reflection in their writing.
- The use of dialogue brings the story to life and adds authenticity to the narrative.

Areas of Concern:
- The introduction is weak and lacks a clear hook or attention-grabbing statement. Consider starting with a more engaging opening sentence to captivate the reader from the beginning.
- The essay lacks a clear focus or central theme. It jumps from discussing the writer's dislike of throw-up to their experiences as a camp counselor without a clear connection between the two.
- The narrative feels disjointed and lacks a smooth flow. The transitions between paragraphs and ideas need improvement to create a cohesive and coherent essay.
- The essay relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Consider incorporating more descriptive language and vivid imagery to engage the reader and bring the story to life.
- The conclusion feels abrupt and doesn't provide a final reflection or takeaway. Consider adding a concluding paragraph that summarizes the growth and lessons learned from the experience.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the introduction to include a compelling hook that immediately draws the reader in. Consider starting with a vivid description of the moment the writer first encountered throw-up to create a sense of suspense or curiosity.

3. Improve the flow and coherence of the essay by ensuring smooth transitions between paragraphs and ideas. Use transition words or phrases to guide the reader through the essay and create a logical progression of thoughts.

Remember to revise and proofread the essay for grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure errors. Consider seeking feedback from teachers, mentors, or other trusted individuals to further improve the essay's overall quality. Good luck!"
"""Hello ! No. I'm at the movies."" Translation: ""Mom! No. I'm at the movies. The movies! I'll be home soon."" If I'm with my friends, someone will ask: ""What was that?"" And I answer, ""I was speaking in Korean to my mom."" This answer is never enough, as I have learned. Only after a few rounds of saying odd phrases for their amusement is everyone's curiosity satisfied. ""How do you say ______?"" they say. I answer patiently in Korean. I am bilingual. Most of my friends have witnessed my trait in action many times. I speak English at school, and mostly Korean at home, but when the two are intertwined, the English and Korean are hard to separate. My internal Korean and the English, that has perhaps become internal now, blend smoothly. The blending of both languages occurs quite often and quite naturally, in and out of the house.

The problems arise when these two worlds start to fight with each other. One fights the other for more attention, and both struggle to pull me in and own me completely. Then these two different worlds can be quite confusing, especially when I blurt something out at the spur of the moment and it comes out in the wrong language. I might roll my eyes and with a sigh say, ""Duh,"" to my parents when they don't really understand the connotation. Or I might yell, "" !"" (No!) while arguing with my friends. The fine line shrinks even thinner. Balancing is the challenge. When you are immersed in two completely separate worlds simultaneously, it is not a dichotomy or an absolute division. The trick is to be both while being one. The two entities are completely different but never alone. That is who I am. I have had to master this skill because I am bilingual and because I am a Korean living in America.

In the Korean realm, those who do not speak Korean can be rejected, ridiculed, or even ostracized. There is an unspoken expectation that a Korean must be able to speak his or her native language and still speak English. Although bad English is understandable, bad Korean is humiliating. Pronunciation, intonation, and grammar must be flawless. If it's not perfect, you are labeled a sell out or a ""Twinkie,"" one who has yellow skin but feels white on the inside. So essentially, you are excluded from both. My friend Joel is the ultimate ""Twinkie."" Sadly for him, he speaks no Korean and his English is bad too; it has a tinge of an accent that shouldn't be there. Joel struggles with being ""too American"" or ""too Korean"" or not enough of both. He knows as well as I do that proficiency in both languages is very important: English is essential to live life in America, yet Korean is essential to retain our culture. That day when Joel asked me how I ""found myself,"" I told him: ""It's a blending of the two without compromising either, and I really think I've found the perfect balance. I'm in the best place that I could ever be: in both.""www.cracksat.net

"As I am filing all those college applications, the question keeps coming back to me. Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I heading?

Am I African? Am I French? Am I Caribbean? Or…soon an American college student?

As I reflect on my African roots, my French and Caribbean upbringings, and now, my new life in America, I could compare myself with a palm tree, being laughed at by an African baobab.

I will always remain deeply rooted in my African ground. Actually I am a palm tree here—a very hard to knock down palm tree. My neighbor is a friendly Baobab. He is my companion on this red ground. He is so tall and so powerful I sometimes get jealous. He is impressive, also. Who am I? Well, he may be tall, powerful, impressive, strong…whatever; at least I, the palm tree, did also grow up in France, unlike Baobab who will never see the French sun. Baobab does not like me thinking that way. He gets mad at me. Anyway, as he says, he absolutely does not need the French sun. His is the brightest, the yellowest, and the warmest sun on earth: the African sun!

The African sun has those qual- ities, for sure. But, dear Baobab, I also know about them. Indeed, it is the African sun that, a long time ago, made my first seed grow. It is also this African sun that gave me that strong color, and the red of my sap. Dear Baobab, I have experienced the virtues of the African sun. But I have also experienced the virtues of travel. Though I remain the same palm tree.

Baobab does not appreciate my comment. Blowing, bowing, his devil eye confirms his saying: the French sun would never make me as tall as him. He is right. I am not that tall, certainly not as tall as he is. But my branches are wide, so wide that I can embrace different cultures from all over the world. Plus, dear Baobab, may I mention that your flowers lack some vitality…some brightness? I keep on considering your flowers, and they definitely cannot compete with mine: mine are brightly, joyfully colored; they actually come from French Guiana, to be precise. I am the only palm tree with rainbow flowers welcoming so many butterflies.

Baobab does not like my reasoning. Neither what I say, nor the calm I say it with.

""Who do you think you are?"" he asks me, screaming.

I am me. I am always the same. Wherever I go, whatever I go through. Today, my flowers are covered with Vermont snow. Tomorrow, who knows…? For sure I am small, but I am rich, rich with those different weathers I go through, with those new experiences that each season and each trip brings me. Baobab stares at me; he looks confused. Then he bows until he reaches my height and, delicately, he uses his height to protect me from the snowfall. What's next? Baobab is curious.

Well, dear Baobab, for now I am still a bit sleepy, but soon will come spring and my flowers will blossom, paving the way for a new adventure: America!www.cracksat.net

Overall, this essay is unique in its approach and showcases the writer's ability to weave together their diverse background and experiences. However, there are some areas that could be improved to make the essay more impactful and memorable.

Strengths:
1. Creative Comparison: The writer's use of comparing themselves to a palm tree and the baobab is a clever and creative way to convey their cultural background and experiences.
2. Vivid Imagery: The essay is filled with vivid descriptions, such as the African sun, the red ground, and the brightly colored flowers. This helps to bring the reader into the writer's world.
3. Embracing Different Cultures: The writer's ability to embrace and appreciate different cultures is an admirable quality and is effectively conveyed through their description of the rainbow flowers and the butterflies.

Areas of Concern:
1. Lack of Coherence: The essay tends to jump from one topic to another without a clear flow or progression. The transitions between the writer's background, their experiences, and their future plans could be smoother.
2. Lack of Focus: While the essay explores the writer's cultural background and experiences, it does not effectively address the prompt of ""Who am I?"" and ""Where am I heading?"" As a result, the essay feels somewhat disconnected and lacks a clear central theme.
3. Superficial Analysis: The writer briefly mentions their experiences and travel, but does not delve into the deeper impact they have had on their personal growth and development. It would be beneficial for the writer to provide more introspection and reflection on how these experiences have shaped their identity and aspirations.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Establish a Clear Narrative: Start the essay with a strong and engaging introduction that grabs the reader's attention and sets the tone for the rest of the essay. Develop a clear narrative that connects the writer's background, experiences, and future goals.
2. Strengthen Transitions: Pay attention to the flow of the essay and ensure that there are smooth transitions between different ideas and paragraphs. Use transitional phrases or sentences to create a logical progression of thoughts.
3. Provide More Depth and Analysis: Take the time to reflect on the writer's experiences and provide deeper insights into how they have influenced their identity and aspirations. This will help to convey the writer's personal growth and maturity.
4. Connect Back to the Prompt: Make sure to address the prompt directly by exploring who the writer is at their core and where they see themselves heading in the future. This will add focus and cohesion to the essay.

In terms of rating, I would give this essay a score of 70. While it possesses some strong elements, such as creativity and vivid imagery, it lacks cohesiveness and depth. With some revisions and improvements, the essay has the potential to rise to a higher score and become a truly memorable personal statement."
"In your own words, describe your personal characteristics, accomplishments, primary interests, plans, and goals. What sets you apart?

I won my school's Pickleball tournament in tenth grade. How many National Merit Semi-Finalists can say that?

What? That's not enough to set me apart in the massive pile of applications? Well, maybe I hold the world record for most snow cones eaten in the summer of 2004, or the record for most piggy back rides given as a camp counselor. I'll have to double check on those. Academically, I'm valedictorian of my class. My sixth grade graduating class, that is. I gave a speech and everything.

Well, perhaps my work with autistic children would set me apart. Has anyone else mentioned being stabbed in the eye with a plastic zebra? (Fear not, my eyesight fully recovered a few minutes later.) Aside from that incident, the experience I had volunteering in a special education classroom has motivated me to pursue autism studies at a graduate and post-graduate level. I want to solve autism's puzzles. I want to research, to discover, and to cure. I want to make my mark in one of science's most fascinating and mysterious fields.

I only failed my driving test once.

I've won awards for placing seventh nationally in the Grand Concours National French Exam, but I'm also building my Spanish vocabulary by watching soap operas on Telemundo. ""?Como puedes llegarme, Consuelo?"" See? That's academic initiative.

How about wanting to change the world? I've been active in my school's chapter of Amnesty International, I petitioned local government to support amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act to protect youth workers, and my peers know never to challenge me in a debate over gay rights.

Also, two of my best friends have webbed toes. I don't know whether or not that means I get along best with people who are part duck, but it's an interesting coincidence.

Maybe, in order to stand out, I should focus on awards and other honors. I won the Brown University Book Award, and I also won the ""Streaker"" award for a particularly unattractive tan line at a recent camp. Plus, I was inducted into the National Honor Society around the time someone titled me the ""least aggravating person in the world.""

In the end, I could describe dozens of things that would suggest unique motivation, interests, or personality traits. However, I think the best representation of myself cannot be restricted to five hundred typed words. Perhaps I've scribbled in more correct bubbles on my standardized tests than some, but I think my biggest accomplishment is the confidence I've built in my entire person. I haven't spent my entire life trying to be a student at an elite university, I've spent it trying to be the best, most well-rounded person I can be. I hope, in the long run, that this is what will truly set me apart.www.cracksat.net

I would rate this essay a 65 out of 100.

Strengths:
- The essay is written in a conversational and informal tone, which makes it easy to read and adds some personality.
- The writer shows a sense of humor and self-awareness throughout the essay.
- The writer mentions a variety of experiences and achievements, which demonstrates their involvement in different areas.
- The essay ends on a reflective note, emphasizing personal growth and development.

Areas of Concern:
- The essay lacks a clear structure or organization. It jumps between different topics and achievements without a clear thread connecting them all.
- The essay relies too heavily on humor and self-deprecation, which can come across as flippant and undermine the writer's credibility.
- The writer mentions several achievements and experiences, but they don't go into detail or provide concrete examples. This makes it difficult for the reader to fully understand the writer's accomplishments.
- The references to the Pickleball tournament, snow cones, sixth-grade valedictorian, and failing the driving test detract from the overall impression of the essay.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Establish a clear structure: Begin with a compelling opening that introduces the main theme or idea of the essay. Then, organize subsequent paragraphs around specific achievements or experiences that showcase the writer's personal characteristics, interests, and goals. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and provide concrete examples or anecdotes to support the writer's claims.

2. Focus on the most meaningful experiences: Instead of mentioning a multitude of achievements and experiences without much detail, choose a few that are the most significant or relevant to the writer's goals. Provide more specific examples and descriptions to bring these experiences to life and show their impact on the writer.

3. Balance humor with seriousness: While some humor can add personality to the essay, it's important to strike the right balance. The writer should be mindful not to rely too heavily on jokes or self-deprecating remarks, as this can undermine the overall impression of the essay. Instead, aim to convey the writer's unique qualities and accomplishments in a tone that is both engaging and professional.

4. Connect experiences to the writer's goals: Throughout the essay, make sure to explicitly tie the writer's experiences and achievements to their primary interests, plans, and goals. This will help admissions officers understand how these experiences have shaped the writer's aspirations and why they are a strong fit for their desired field of study.

Overall, this essay has potential but needs significant revision to present a more cohesive and compelling narrative. The writer should carefully consider which experiences and achievements are the most relevant and meaningful, and provide specific examples and descriptions to support their claims. By focusing on demonstrating personal growth, clear goals, and a genuine passion for their chosen field, the writer can make their personal statement more memorable and impactful."
"""So, you want this car or not?"" Dr. Matt Petrilla asked again, in his simultaneously pushy yet polite manner.

This smart, stocky man, a medical doctor and the father of a friend, had thrown me into a sudden state of blissful surprise: less than a minute before, he had offered me a free car. We set a time for me to test-drive the car, and then he left me astonished and dazed.

Since my early childhood, when I begged my father to let me drive the golf cart at every opportunity, and when I developed a certain fascination with bumper cars, driving has always ranked high on my short list of life's great pleasures. Most of all, it affords the extreme satisfaction of independence, that glorious freedom for which the adolescent heart traditionally yearns. The idea of having my own car floored me.

That night, I told my father about the car. Until then, he had provided me with a car for regular use but not one I could call my own. ""That just doesn't happen!"" he exclaimed disbelievingly. He spoke in total favor of accepting the car, since he loathes denying what he calls his ""thrifty Scottish side""; his mannerisms, however, were not entirely in synch with his words. In my overriding excitement, I did not see what exactly had disheartened him.

A few days later, Dr. Matt handed me the key to my new car: a forest green, 1993 Mazda 626 sedan, fitted with the most comfortable beige leather and a brand-new CD player. Dr. Matt, who thrives on rebuilding wrecked cars and giving them to kids in the community out of sheer generosity, also proved his genius by converting it from automatic to manual transmission, since he knew how much I enjoyed the stick shift. On the way home, I quickly popped in my new CD of Respighi's Pines of Rome and trembled in ecstasy as my car's powerful speakers pummeled my senses with the grand final movement, ""The Pines of the Via Appia."" I was in love.

Over the next three weeks however, despite my great contentment with the car itself, conflicting emotions beset me. Guilt bothered me most: ""Why do I deserve this car? Shouldn't I give this car to someone who needs it more?"" I often asked myself. I also felt guilt concerning my father's feelings, for now I understood his initial distress: he had worked diligently to provide an extra car for his family, and he knew how much it meant to me to be able to drive; I felt that I was almost disrespectful of my father by accepting this gift, though he would never mention it. The now-burdensome car caused both my mind and my driveway to become a little too crowded.

I agonized over what to do, since returning such a stunning gift bordered on the unthinkable, but in the end I found clarity. I returned the car to Dr. Matt, who completely understood my dilemma. No decision had ever so thoroughly freed me. Dr. Matt now could give the car to another thrilled kid, and again I could appreciate my father's gift. Never in my life did I think I would turn down a free car, but in this case, nothing could have made better sense.www.cracksat.net

"You have just completed your 300-page autobiography. Please submit page 217.

I remember feeling my stomach do a flip turn as I watched who entered the room. A friend of mine was sitting in front of the Honor Council. At my high school, the Honor Council is an elected group of six students including four faculty advisors, which hears cases of students who have broken the school's honor code: ""I pledge on my honor not to lie, cheat, steal, plagiarize, or vandalize."" I was elected at the end of my sophomore year to the position and had promised my peers to hear cases with an unbiased ear and to speak for all of them in the panel's discussions. It was not until I was hearing the case of a friend that I knew how difficult that promise was going to be.

As the meeting started, I quickly learned that she was the person who had been stealing money from lockers. The most troubling aspect of the case was that we had been friends since the third grade and had shared a number of special moments; I had never expected her to be the culprit. I remembered her dethroning me as champion in a multiplication game in Lower School and more recently joking about one of the funnier names in our AP US History book, Terrence Powderly. These thoughts echoed as she began her testimony.

She stated that she merely found herself stealing money one day, and then the problem grew into a destructive habit. She asked for our forgiveness. After she left, the council discussed proper punishments, which included expulsion, for nearly an hour and a half. I weighed our friendship and my knowledge that she was a kind person versus her serious, knowing transgression. When the time for the vote finally came, I felt physically and emotionally drained, but I had reached a decision. I raised my hand in favor of expulsion. I knew that my convictions for upholding the honor code were too strong to not vote for her removal. Her violations had been clear and unequivocal, and although she was my friend, I did not feel that she could remain at our school. The final decision rested on the head of school.

I learned a few days later that my friend had indeed been expelled, and that part of what influenced the head of school's decision was the Honor Council's unanimous vote favoring expulsion. I was extremely disappointed to see a friend leave the school, but I knew that her blatant disregard for the values of the community made her unfit to attend. I was proud that I had assembled the courage to vote for expulsion, especially when my fellow junior on the council abstained from voting. I believe that deciding whether to favor the expulsion of a fellow student and friend was one of the most difficult decisions of my life. It was only after I had seen the school's secretary clean out my friend's locker that I realized how much courage I had mustered to make such an emotional decision.www.cracksat.net

It effectively captures the internal conflict and emotional turmoil the student experienced, as well as the consequences of their decision. However, there are areas for improvement that can enhance the impact of the essay.

Strengths:
- The essay effectively sets the stage by providing context and explaining the role of the Honor Council.
- The author demonstrates self-awareness and reflects on the challenge of remaining unbiased in the face of a personal relationship.
- The use of specific anecdotes, such as the multiplication game and the AP US History book, adds depth to the narrative and helps to create a vivid picture of the friendship.
- The description of the decision-making process and the subsequent consequences is clear and concise.
- There is a strong sense of the student's values and commitment to upholding the honor code.

Areas of Concern:
- The essay lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. It would benefit from a more explicit statement of the central theme and a reflection on the larger significance of the experience.
- There is limited insight into the student's thought process and emotional journey. The essay could explore the internal struggle more deeply to convey a stronger sense of the weight of the decision.
- The essay could benefit from more vivid and descriptive language. This would help to engage the reader and make the narrative more memorable.
- The inclusion of additional examples or anecdotes, particularly those that provide insight into the friendship and the student's values, would strengthen the essay.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Begin the essay with a clear introduction that sets up the central theme of difficult decision-making and the honor code.
2. Add more specific details and vivid language to engage the reader and make the narrative more memorable. For example, instead of simply stating that the student felt physically and emotionally drained, describe the physical sensations and the emotional turmoil in more detail.
3. Offer deeper insights into the student's thought process and emotional journey. How did the conflicting emotions impact their decision? How did the experience change their understanding of friendship and integrity?
4. Include additional anecdotes or examples that provide insight into the friendship and the student's values. This could help to create a more nuanced and impactful narrative.
5. Conclude the essay by reflecting on the larger significance of the experience and how it has shaped the student's understanding of honor and integrity.

Rating: 75/100. While the essay effectively captures the difficult decision the student had to make, there is room for improvement in terms of structure, descriptive language, and deeper reflection. With some revisions, this essay has the potential to be a standout piece in a college application."
"A ball is rolled down the lane. Confidently, I turn around; there is no need to see the result. A perfect strike. I stroll back to the bench, receiving high-fives from not only my teammates, but the opposing team as well. Bowling has been my most satisfying extracurricular activity. Turning with a smile on my face to my teammates knowing I threw a strike, without having to see it, feels amazing. On the other hand, it can prove a little embarrassing when a pin is left standing.

When I was in ninth grade, I tried out and made the freshmen basketball team. Spending almost the entire season on the bench was not an enjoyable experience. While my spirit to play was strong, my height of 5'2"" was an impediment. The next year I decided to try bowling instead of putting myself through another year of warming the bench. Bowling is an equal opportunity sport, where it doesn't matter if you're short, fat, or even deaf, dumb, and blind. It is the only sport I know of that you can eat french fries and play cards during practice. Bowling matches and practices are always fun as we never have to do strenuous wind sprints and no one ever gets injured. My teammates and I get to relax and have fun.

On good days, it is satisfying to know that I can throw a strike on any shot. My best game to date is a 266. On the other hand, I have also experienced the ""agony"" of getting a gutter ball. We often joke with each other about throwing gutter balls; claiming it ""hit my leg"" to use as an excuse.

It is amazing to see how although as individuals we don't have a lot in common, yet as teammates, we bond. The team is very sup-portive; we cheer when someone does well and give encouragement when one of us throws a bad shot. I have never quite experienced that kind of team sportsmanship before. As a varsity bowler, I enjoy helping the younger JV bowlers perfect their game. I have spent numerous practices working with one freshman in particular to improve his approach to the shot (unfortunately, my efforts had limited success).

My own game has improved as well. Sophomore year, when we went to the Westchester/Putnam sectionals, I was really nervous and I did not bowl up to the expectations I had for myself. In contrast, junior year, we qualified again and I averaged fifteen pins better than my season average. My skills, along with my confidence, had significantly improved. This newfound confidence has spread to other areas of my life. Recently, I had to give a speech for Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society) and I was pleasantly surprised with the ease I felt at delivering the speech. While bowling is not as glamorous as football or basketball (no cheerleaders), for me it will always be wonderful way to spend an afternoon.www.cracksat.net

"After deciding it would be fun to play a sport in high school, I joined my school's water polo team as a freshman. Although I had never been particularly athletically inclined, I threw myself into the sport with total energy and enthusiasm, hoping to be a starting player. I worked incredibly hard, arriving at practice early to swim extra laps, and staying after everyone else had left to work on my technique. But no matter what I did, I was still only an average player. Why couldn't I score more goals? In school, I knew that when I completely immersed myself in the material and devoted extra effort to my classes, good grades usually followed. I had become accustomed to my hard work and dedication being rewarded. So I was naturally disappointed when devoting the same tremendous amount of effort to water polo did not yield similar results.

I began to ask myself, why was I doing this? It was embarrassing and even somewhat humiliating for me to participate in an activity that I couldn't do as well as others could. I could not help but be I realized that if I really wanted to participate in an activity I loved, I could not let my embarrassment or false pride stand in the way frustrated when my coach yelled at me during practices, benched me during games, or when I saw the weekly sheet of statistics being tacked up by the pool for all of the players to see. I even began to wonder whether participating in water polo was worthwhile if it were something at which I could not excel.

However, I would never allow myself to quit. For even though I was not the best player on the team, I am not a quitter and the truth was I love playing water polo. I enjoyed the physical challenge it gave me, swimming as hard as I could until every muscle in my body ached. When I didn't get to play, I took pleasure in analyzing our game strategies, sometimes discussing ideas with my coach, even going so far as to very subtly suggest his strategy was wrong. I was amazed to learn I could actually enjoy the time I spent on the bench, often inventing cheers to support other players. I realized that if I really wanted to participate in an activity I loved, I could not let my embarrassment or false pride stand in the way. And because I refused to give up, participating in water polo has been simultaneously one of the most frustrating and yet rewarding experiences of my life. I found the determination not to walk away from something that was especially difficult for me. And although I was raised with the notion that every goal was within my reach if I simply worked hard enough, I now understand that I don't have to do something better than everyone else in order to be successful.www.cracksat.net

"Glaring floodlights illuminated the brisk autumn night, steam rose from the sweaty players, and screams rang from the abnormally large crowd. With less than ten minutes left to play, the game remained a scoreless draw. I was the only freshman on the field, and I had been running on sheer adrenaline for nearly the whole second half. The ball floated into the penalty box, and I instinctively darted to meet the beautifully arching cross. With a slight jump and a deft touch off my right cleat, I watched the ball as it sailed just beyond the outstretched arms of the goalkeeper. That goal proved the winner as we rallied past the top-ranked team in the state.

Rarely does success and meaning in life come without toil. While last-gasp goals and hard-fought victories stand out in my memory, the importance of my soccer experience cannot pertain to any one set of events. It includes countless hours in the backyard, early morning timed runs, hard-fought losses, agonizing poor performances, and all the small but sweet accomplishments on the practice pitch. I have cherished the entire evolution of my twelve-year career, and the lessons I have learned that transcend the game of soccer. My experiences with soccer have taught me the importance of dedication and perseverance, the value of camaraderie and teamwork, and the ways to harness raw emotion. More importantly, however, my involvement in soccer has provided me with valuable insight on life. The game of soccer is not so much a sport as an advanced art form. It requires a combination of mental, physical, and technical ability, accentuated by instances of innate skill and creativity. Whereas most sports require strict rules, carefully calculated plays, and numerous breaks, soccer is an amoeba of continuous, fluid motion. On the field, soccer players are given the liberty to be artists, perpetually adjusting and tending to the movement of play. Life itself is continuous motion. The ""beautiful game"" has taught me to be an artist in everything I do, forever tending to and sculpting the events of my own life.www.cracksat.net

"One overpowering image appears whenever I remember my middle school years: the Dark Ages in Europe. Was I suffering through isolation, oppression, or misery? Fortunately not, yet I was, as Plato would put it, in the gloom of my cave, bereft of the light of intellectual illumination.

I liken my early childhood, a time of radiant learning, to Greek and Roman antiquity. Whenever a particular topic (like dinosaurs, wildlife, or astronomy) seized my interest, I would read every wisp of related information I could find. In Classical Greek and Roman fashion, I laid the foundations of my future through my love of reading in my childhood. I stopped reading for pleasure, however, when I reached adolescence and became consumed with athletics. Like the Europeans after the fall of the Roman Empire, I vaguely sensed that something great still existed, dormant but waiting to be reborn.

As Dante's The Divine Comedy ignited the Italian Renaissance, J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings rekindled my dormant love of reading and ignited my life's Renaissance. Seeing Peter Jackson's first ""LOTR"" movie in ninth grade inspired me to tackle the book itself. Immediately, I was swept off into Tolkien's heroic tale. I discovered a story, inspired by the ancient world's greatest legends and myths, with profound relevance to the modern world though its timeless themes of friendship, courage, corruption, good and evil, war and peace, victory and defeat, love and hate, and hope and despair. I was moved by, as C. S. Lewis put it, ""Beauties which pierce like swords."" I felt like St. Paul when the Lord knocked him off his horse on the road to Damascus. For the first time, I realized that literature helps us discover how we want to live and where we want to go in the future.

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the philosophers of the Enlightenment brought about remarkable progress by re-evaluating Europe's previously accepted doctrines and traditions. Reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X incited my Enlightenment. The book demonstrated how personal growth comes from hav- ing honesty, compassion, and a capacity for sincere introspection. Malcolm X's story gave me, for the first time in my life, an open mind. I recognized how everyone, including me, will instinctively clutch onto preconceived beliefs and prejudices. Additionally, Malcolm X's remarkable regard for history taught me that without an understanding of the past, there is no wisdom to guide us in the future.

The future is uncertain. We will face many great challenges in the twenty-first century: achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, defeating the ideology of Islamic Jihadism, and harnessing the energy of globalization to improve the human condition. Difficult choices must be made to meet these challenges, and I want to help make those decisions. My favorite stories have armed me with a love of reading and the sense of history and faith I need to face the future with enthusiasm. That is why I'm so excited to discover what the future will hold.www.cracksat.net

"I can't imagine wanting straight hair. People suggest it all the time, but I simply could never change my hair. It's a part of my identity, part of the reason people remember me. You see, it's not your ordinary hair—it's HUGE. And I'm not just talking curly; I'm talking mega frizzy and tangled. But no matter how difficult it is to manage, I would never get rid of it because my hair defines who I am.

The bottom layer is actually fairly straight and smooth. It's orderly, predictable and easy to manage, kind of like a part of me. I'm organized. Never mind that my room may be completely covered with piles of clothes. Still I can always find my favorite pink t-shirt or that last Harry Potter book. Maybe my room is the epitome of organized chaos. That bottom layer of hair is calm, not too frizzy, again, relaxed like me. I've always been one to chill, maybe watch a movie rather than stay out prowling till unprecedented hours of the morning.

The top layer of my hair is oh so different. It spikes like crazy; it puffs as if the laws of physics didn't apply to certain renegade strands. Actually it's crazy and unpredictable, kind of like another part of me. I've always had a creative, somewhat impulsive streak, whether it was inventing games to play with my brother or building a tower with ketchup-cups from McDonald's. I absolutely love to make things. When I was eight, one of my birthday presents was a huge box of tape and string of assorted types and colors. I was so blissfully happy with those simple, but magical ""art supplies."" I used it all within a few days making various tape contraptions which even blocked the stairs. I'm creative. I'm unpredictable, just like my hair. I like to try new things, to extend into new directions like that renegade curl refusing to lay flat.

Without a shower in the morning and copious amounts of gels and mousse, I look like I've just been mauled overnight by a large bear. But actually I'm ok with chaotic hair. It's me; it's wild, crazy, and unpredictable, and yet with care, creativity and effort, it can actually be tamed, organized. Trust me. People remember me because of my hair. That's exactly who I am. I'm me, Andie MacDonald, the girl with the HUGE HAIR.www.cracksat.net

Strengths:
- The essay effectively conveys the writer's strong attachment to their hair and how it defines their identity.
- The use of hair as a metaphor for different aspects of the writer's personality is creative and engaging.
- The writer connects their hair to their creativity and unpredictability, providing specific examples and anecdotes to support their claims.
- The essay has a consistent tone and voice, reflecting the writer's personality.

Areas of concern:
- The essay lacks a clear focus or central theme beyond the writer's hair. While the hair metaphor is interesting, it does not fully develop the writer's qualities and characteristics that would make them a standout applicant.
- The essay could benefit from more depth and introspection. It tends to rely on surface-level descriptions and observations rather than exploring the writer's thoughts, emotions, and growth.
- Some of the examples used, such as organizing clothes and watching movies, feel mundane and do not effectively demonstrate the writer's unique qualities or experiences.
- The conclusion feels abrupt and does not provide a satisfying ending or final thought.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Start the essay with a clear thesis statement that indicates what qualities or characteristics the writer wants to highlight through their hair metaphor.
- Develop a stronger and more consistent narrative thread throughout the essay. Instead of just describing different aspects of the hair and the writer's personality, focus on specific experiences or moments that shaped the writer's identity and connect back to the hair metaphor.
- Show more vulnerability and reflect on personal growth. How has the writer's relationship with their hair evolved over time? How has it impacted their self-confidence and self-expression?
- Replace some of the mundane examples with more unique and impactful experiences that showcase the writer's creativity, impulsiveness, and willingness to try new things.
- Revise the conclusion to provide a more meaningful and memorable ending. Consider tying together the different strands of the hair metaphor and how they contribute to the writer's overall identity and outlook on life.

Overall, this essay has potential but needs further development to become a truly compelling personal statement. With more depth, introspection, and a stronger narrative structure, it has the potential to stand out among other college applications."
"Potential to Contribute: Tell us about a talent, experience, contribution, or personal quality you will bring to the University of California.

In my six-year-old mind I see the president, sitting at his plush desk chair in a navy blue suit. He's examining an important document. Or better yet, he's in the middle of a crucial meeting with leaders from all over the world. His secretary enters. She looks worried. ""We've received a letter of some importance,"" she says. His brow furrows as she hands him a small envelope addressed in sparkly pink pen. ""Anne Erickson, age six, Oakland, California,"" he muses, examining the careful writing. He rips open the envelope to read my note. ""My God, Louise, it's regarding dolphin-safe tuna. Call out the National Guard!"" Louise would head over to that red telephone, dial a few numbers, and the powers of the U.S. government would be unleashed for the sake of my carefully articulated plea for the dolphins.

It was lucky that I learned to write just as my emerging sense of justice took hold—my letters gave me an outlet for my worries about the world. I remember the feeling of satisfaction it gave me to stick those letters in the mailbox. I was, after all, imparting crucial information: someday, when they were old and retired, the politicians would all thank me. ""If it hadn't been for that little girl,"" they would say, ""I'd never have known about those dolphins.""

I was thrilled when I received my first presidential envelope in the mail, but soon became indignant to discover that the president sent me the same photocopy in response to each of my painstakingly crafted letters. I didn't give up, however. I simply broadened my target audience, pursuing my dream of a planet safe for animals through posters, clubs, subscriptions to Greenpeace newsletters, and the sheltering of a variety of odd creatures. The Norwegian ambassador renewed my faith in humanity when he sent me a handwritten note in response to my concerns about whaling.

As I've grown, so has my perspective on environmental issues. I still feel just as passionately about the need to save the dolphins, the whales, and all manner of animals, but my passion has been complicated by my slow realization that everything needs ""saving""— even humans. A trip to South Africa when I was fourteen left me addicted to international travel, and I came away just as intrigued by that country's people and politics as by its monkeys and lions. Volunteer work in Panama and Honduras has shown me firsthand how difficult it is to strike a balance between human survival and environmental preservation: I'm still angry when I hear about ""slash-and-burn"" deforestation on TV, yet in the Panamanian village that was my home for two months, burning trees meant farmland, survival, and a way of life for my host family.

My loyalties and passions have expanded as I learn more about the world. In both Panama and Honduras, I worked in schools with kids I adored, and learned to discuss politics and history in Spanish. This fall, I used that Spanish in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I became an Election Day volunteer, getting my first taste of political action and becoming acquainted with volunteers from across the nation, not to mention the unforgettable residents of Albuquerque precincts 67 and 73.

I am no longer the little girl with the one-track mind who wrote letters to the president. Each time I discover something new about myself—my interest in politics, in public health, in teaching—life certainly becomes more frustrating and complex. But my passion for new experiences, and my tenacity and commitment to working for true justice in the world, has never wavered: it will follow me into college and beyond.www.cracksat.net

Overall, this essay presents a unique and engaging narrative of the writer's development and evolving passion for the environment and social justice. The opening paragraph is attention-grabbing and sets the tone for a compelling story. The use of vivid imagery, such as the image of the president receiving a letter from a six-year-old, is effective in drawing the reader in.

The essay effectively conveys the writer's dedication to environmental conservation and animal welfare. The anecdotes about writing letters to politicians and receiving a response from the Norwegian ambassador showcase their commitment and persistence. Additionally, the story of the trip to South Africa and the volunteer work in Panama and Honduras shows the writer's expanding worldview and the connection between human survival and environmental concerns. The mention of working in schools and getting involved in political action adds depth to the writer's experiences and interests.

One of the strengths of this essay is how it demonstrates personal growth and maturity. The writer acknowledges that their perspective has evolved over time and expresses a more complex understanding of the world's challenges. This shows critical thinking and openness to new experiences.

However, there are some areas for improvement. First, the essay could benefit from a clearer connection to the University of California (UC). While the writer discusses their passions and experiences, they do not explicitly tie these to what they would bring to the UC community. It would be helpful for the writer to highlight specific aspects of the UC campus or programs that align with their interests and how they would contribute to and benefit from them.

Additionally, although the essay dives into the writer's various experiences, it lacks a clear structure or organization. The transitions between the different anecdotes and reflections could be smoother to create a more cohesive narrative. Consider using headings or paragraphs to separate different sections and make them easier to follow.

Furthermore, while the essay portrays the writer's passion, there is room to strengthen the argument and showcase a deeper understanding of the pressing environmental and social justice issues. The writer could engage more critically and analytically with these topics, providing a more nuanced perspective and demonstrating a deeper knowledge.

In terms of writing style, the essay is generally engaging, but there are instances where it could be more concise and precise. Some sentences could be rephrased to enhance clarity and flow.

In conclusion, this essay presents a captivating story of the writer's journey from writing letters to the president to engaging in political action and volunteer work. The personal growth and broadening of perspectives are evident throughout. However, to enhance the essay, the writer should focus on making explicit connections to the UC community and reinforcing their understanding of environmental and social justice issues. Additionally, restructuring and refining the writing style will further strengthen the overall impact. With these improvements, the essay has the potential to be a standout piece that resonates with top-tier admissions officers.

"It was my fifth birthday. Imagine the joy that must pulse through the veins of a hungry homeless person who just happens to find a winning lottery ticket laying in the gutter. The look on that person's face would be much like the one I wore when tearing apart my present to reveal nothing more than a bag of marbles. The marbles fascinated me. They weren't just pretty pieces of painted glass smoothed into a nice round sparkling ball. There were worlds, whole universes even, contained within the intricate weavings within them. It made my little mind wander through uncharted mind quests, thinking that perhaps my house, my town, my world, was also contained within a marble cherished by another little girl.

One by one, my beloved marbles were swept under the carpets, consumed by the vacuum cleaner, or lost on the playground, until one day I had one marble left. It was a hot, humid day in the middle of June and my mother was outside making some new additions to her perennial flower bed. I'd been observing her work over the past few months and noticed a fairly simple pattern: she would dig a small hole, put in a tiny round object, and a few weeks later there would sprout a beautiful flower. Well, my naive brilliant self had a far better plan, and I at once set forth upon planting my glass ball in hopes of growing a ""bed of marbles.""

Ten years passed, and the marble garden had been long forgotten. Then one day, my mother was carrying out her annual gardening ritual, when suddenly a shimmering blue-green marble surfaced in the dirt. She hastily called me to her side, placed it in my hand, and instantly the flashback of my childhood endeavor played through my mind. Naturally, I kept the marble in a safe place—the safe place being a zippered pocket in my purse. It was as if I'd suddenly been showered in good fortune from the good-luck gods. At the time, I attributed much of my luck in making it to the county-wide spelling bee to my marble, as well as actually being admitted into the Maine School of Science and Math.

It is with great regret that I report the mysterious disappear- ance of this marble which I have cherished most of my life, as silly as it may be. I would love to finally discover where exactly my marble vanished to. It is a deep shade of indigo, and when you hold it up to the sun it shimmers in an iridescent green that will take your breath away. If you happen to discover my marble laying on a park bench, or upon a table at a yard sale, please, call my toll-free hotline at I-MISS-MY-MRBL. If at all possible, try to make it before I receive my decision letter from Cornell College—I might need a little luck.

"Display dagger. Teddy bear. Cheesecake.

I love cheesecake. In fact, a slice of this delicious dessert is on my desk right now, impaled by a pair of chopsticks. These odd juxtapositions of East and West occur frequently at my house; my mother puts peanut butter into her moon cakes, and my dad uses the coffee maker to boil chrysanthemum tea. My two halves, however, have created a greater whole. I am able to think in both Eastern and Western terms, and I am com-fortable with the philosophies of Plato and Lao Tzu alike, though I do admit to dicey moments in The Republic and the Tao te Ching. Raised in two cultures, I am able to connect to many others. I can be at home at a football game, a Chinese karaoke party, a Japanese tea ceremony, or a French soirée. I am capable of shoveling snow with Buddha.

Jade necklace. Post-it notes. School of Athens.

On the other side of my desk lies a copy of A Brief History of Time. When I was younger, my room was littered not with dolls, but with books about every topic. I idolized the versatile Leonardo Da Vinci, who seemed capable of everything. As I've grown older, I've sometimes felt like a penniless artist forced to meet the expectations of a patron rather than work for my own interests and needs. It is difficult to emulate Da Vinci in a society that emphasizes specializa-tion. Artistic creativity, however, is not a thing to be controlled and confined—and neither is my mind.

Dancing vampire doll. Rush Hour. Army Men.

Last summer, I went to an astronomy camp in the hills of North Carolina, even though it had no significant ""practical value."" There, I saw the Milky Way for the first time. While listening to a profes-sor point out constellations with familiar names and alien shapes, I

marveled anew at the joy of learning for its own sake, with no agenda and no assessment. When I am asked about what I want to do with my life by friends, parents, and college applications, I imagine Da Vinci tinkering with this invention, sketching out that painting, examining yet another plant; choosing a major probably would have driven him insane. I may have been born six centuries too late, but no career can possibly define who I am. I will be the business major who can solder a circuit and paint portraits, the engineer who can recite British poetry and speak in five languages, the artist who knows calculus and can break two boards at once. I will be a Renaissance woman.

Newton's thermometer. Sheet music. CD spool with two discs remaining.

""We Didn't Start the Fire"" is a work of genius—each line

corresponds to a year of Billy Joel's life, and the major events of each year are organized with rhythm and rhyme. A good songwriter like Joel weaves together all the disparate tones, beats, and lyrics of the song into a melody that organizes but does not constrain. As I look through my CD collection, full of the delicately beautiful strains of Prokofiev and the head-banging bass beats of Rammstein, I am reminded that my life, too, must have a melody to keep it valid. Each of my tunes is a singular cacophony, but united they make great harmony. I am composed of many passions, many faces, many

reflections, and the Tao teaches me to let my different parts go their own way. I am neither yin nor yang. I will simply stay in the center of the circle and direct the symphony.

Source Url:https://www.cracksat.net/college-admission/essays/215.html","Essay Critique:

This essay is a unique attempt to showcase the applicant's diverse interests and experiences. The use of unconventional imagery and references, such as the cheesecake impaled by chopsticks, demonstrates the applicant's creativity and ability to think outside the box. Additionally, the essay effectively highlights the applicant's multicultural background and their ability to connect with various cultures.

However, the essay lacks a clear structure or narrative arc. Each paragraph seems disconnected from the others, making it difficult to follow the applicant's train of thought. The essay would benefit from a more cohesive structure that allows the reader to understand the overarching message or theme.

Furthermore, while the essay touches on the applicant's diverse interests, it does not provide enough specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate their experiences. The references to various cultural activities and subjects fall flat without concrete examples or personal anecdotes to bring them to life. 

In terms of language and style, the essay occasionally uses overly complex or verbose language, which can make it difficult to understand. The essay would benefit from more concise and straightforward language, allowing the reader to easily grasp the applicant's ideas.

To improve this essay, I would suggest the following:

1. Develop a clear structure and narrative arc: The essay should have an introduction, body paragraphs that provide specific examples or anecdotes to support the applicant's claims, and a conclusion that ties everything together.

2. Use specific and personal examples: Instead of simply mentioning cultural activities or subjects, provide vivid examples of experiences in each of these areas. This will allow the reader to understand the applicant's level of involvement and how it has shaped their perspective.

3. Simplify language and improve clarity: Avoid using overly complex or verbose language. Focus on clear and concise writing that allows the reader to easily understand the applicant's ideas.

4. Consider adding a central theme or message: While the essay touches on the applicant's diverse interests, it lacks a central theme or message that ties everything together. Adding a central theme or message will make the essay more impactful and memorable.

Overall, I would rate this essay a 60 out of 100. It shows potential with its unique approach and diverse experiences but lacks coherence and specific examples to fully convey the applicant's strengths and interests. With some structural and content revisions, this essay has the potential to become a compelling and memorable personal statement."
"Every Sunday morning until the weather drops below freezing and my parents do not let me use the hose, I wash my car. This may seem like an ordinary job to some, but to me washing a car requires a distinctive technique.

No matter how tired I am, every Sunday morning I wake up, brush my teeth, put on my blue sweatpants and red sweatshirt, grab the keys to the car, and head out into the driveway. Not even the puppy follows me outside; he likes to sleep till eleven o'clock on Sundays. I pull the car out into the driveway and position it just right so that the morning sun is blocked by the thick leaves and branches of the tall maple, and so I can easily walk around the back end.

I then attach the longest hose I can find in the basement of my house to the water spigot, and fill my large gray bucket with just enough soap that when agitated by the pressure from the hose the mixture I am left with is half a bucket of water and half of foam. I let the multicolored sponges soak for two or three minutes. Each sponge is used for a specific task: the yellow for the car body, the red for the wheels and tires, and the orange for cleaning the squashed bugs off the bumper. When the sponges are properly saturated I use the hose to soak the car and begin washing. Contrary to what my parents believe, there is a specific order of washing that must be kept in order to achieve the best quality wash. First, I wash the roof, then the hood, trunk, and only afterwards do I scrub the doors, bumpers, and finally the wheels. In this order the soapy water flows off the top of the car and loosens the dirt on the lower parts, which are then easier to wash.

After everything is washed and rinsed I dry the car off using a white towel to make sure I have not missed any dirty spots which would rub off onto the bleached towel. At this point, the sun is already higher in the sky, so I move the car forward to escape direct rays which warm the paint.

When the car is completely dry I begin to apply the wax again, starting from the roof and working down towards the bottom of the car. The wax dries in two minutes, which gives me just enough time to wax the car if my arm is working at close to the speed of sound. Normally, it takes me a bit longer than that to wax the whole car, so I finish with the waxing in closer to fifteen minutes. I use the orbital polisher to polish the hood, roof, and trunk, while the rest I do by hand, as the polisher does not do a good enough job on curved surfaces. After polishing, I buff the whole car by hand until the paint sparkles, the wheels shine, and the tires look wet.

I vacuum the interior, and clean all the map pockets which accumulate fascinating rubbish throughout the week. I rub lotion into the dashboard to protect it from the sun and I wash the windows where my puppy has mashed his wet nose while riding on the seat.I keep this precision and order every Sunday.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 78/100

Strengths:
- The essay does a good job of highlighting the student's attention to detail and commitment to precision. It effectively communicates the student's passion for washing cars and their specific technique.
- The use of specific details, such as the description of the colored sponges and the order of washing, adds depth to the essay and helps the reader visualize the process.
- The inclusion of the puppy's habits on Sundays adds a touch of personality and helps to paint a fuller picture of the student.

Areas of Concern:
- The essay focuses solely on the task of washing a car and lacks broader significance or meaning. While it showcases the student's diligence and attention to detail, it does not provide insight into the student's character, values, or goals.
- The structure of the essay feels a bit disjointed. It jumps from one task to another without a clear narrative thread or overall purpose.
- The conclusion feels abrupt and does not tie back to the opening paragraph or provide a sense of closure.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Connect the topic to personal growth or a broader theme: The essay would benefit from exploring why car washing is significant to the student beyond the task itself. How has this activity shaped the student's character, values, or problem-solving skills? What life lessons has the student learned from this activity? By connecting the topic to personal growth or a broader theme, the essay will become more meaningful and memorable to the admissions officers.

2. Establish a clear narrative arc: To improve the structure of the essay, consider establishing a clear narrative arc that takes the reader on a journey.

3. Add more diversity in content: While the detailed description of the car washing process is important, the essay would benefit from including more varied examples and anecdotes to showcase the student's abilities and character. Consider sharing other experiences or achievements that highlight different aspects of the student's strengths and skills, beyond just car washing.

4. Strengthen the conclusion: The conclusion should effectively summarize the essay and leave a lasting impression on the reader. Consider tying back to the opening paragraph to create a sense of cohesion. Additionally, reflect on the significance of car washing and explain how it has influenced the student's goals or aspirations for the future.

By implementing these suggestions, the essay can transform into a compelling narrative that not only showcases the student's commitment to car washing but also provides deeper insight into their character and potential for success at the college level.

"It's past late on a Thursday; I'm driving past concrete bridges under the fluorescent glow of streetlights, the German brick of Cincinnati blending into blue-black alleyways. During these trips home when all that faces me are boarded up buildings and barren sidewalks, I feel like a fool. I have a paper to write, a math test tomorrow that I haven't studied for, and yet I dragged myself across town to a squat, dumpy building that smells vaguely of cheese to talk to the world a little bit. Got a call two days ago, went into scramble mode, discarded plans with family and friends, all to sweat over a microphone for two or three hours.

I am a DJ at community radio station WAIF-FM, and go-to substitute. Four in the morning on a Tuesday? I'll be there. Seven on a Saturday night even though I haven't seen my friends in weeks? I'll be there. Some days I regret ever stepping foot in that crummy building, but when the on-air sign goes red, there isn't anything you could do to get me out of the studio.

I started because I had always had a vague curiosity with radio and had come by to watch a friend fill in for a DJ with pneumonia. Two hours later, her show was over and a harried woman came in, told us that someone had quit and offered me his spot. After minimal training, I was on the air two weeks later with the show Kindred Sanction, a local music program. Public Service Announcements, promotional bits, news items and those incessant pleas for money, I do it all while beaming out Cincinnati's finest to the world. I can be good, very good, if I remember that nobody is listening. Then I'm a witty cultural landmark throwing records on the air with flair Wolfman Jack couldn't touch. The only problem is that I occasionally have an audience, and when the phone flashes, I go into panic mode. Oh please no, Oh please yes have there be people listening. Sometimes it's a wrong number and I try to go back to cool announcer Andrea, but hopes have been raised and dashed and I finish the night miffed. More often it's a listener and I am both thrilled and terrified by the prospect. Those times I take comfort in the deserted sidewalks, thinking, maybe some of those people are listening, and maybe, just maybe they like what they heard.www.cracksat.net

"My mom is already telling me that I will have to clean out my room and throw away most of what fills my desk drawers. I am a very sentimental person and keep large quantities of what friends have given me over the years, so it will be hard for me to decide what to discard. The one thing I will never throw away, though, is my letters.

I first began seriously writing letters when I was in fifth grade and found my first pen pal, a cheery girl named Cate from Virginia. We were referred to each other through a magazine and began avidly writing. Cate was not much like me, as she loved horses and hiking while I preferred dogs and writing. Our geographic differences amused us—she couldn't believe I'd never seen a snow storm and I was perplexed when she started playing lacrosse, a sport seldom heard of on the West Coast. But we learned about each other through our letters and I grew close to her—this girl I'd never met who lived three thousand miles away.

She was followed by many others: a girl who lived in West Virginia, another Kate but spelled with a K, who wrote me a letter when she read a story I'd published in a kids' magazine; an elderly lady I knew from Kentucky, Ginny; an old friend from camp, Georgina. I wrote to Frances (named after me), the daughter of a Welsh pen pal my mom had when she was my age. I even began writing to a girl who left my school in eighth grade and lived right over my back fence. Although I saw Sarah occasionally, the way we described our unfolding high school experiences to each other was through our letters. She described her public high school events, like making Homecoming floats, while I told her of my small-school happenings, like the annual lip sync. In my letters, I expressed more and more of myself, igniting my lifelong love of writing. My letters were always keys to self-discovery—I learned who I was through those scribbled sheets. And I kept almost all of my pen pals' letters.In this world of word-processing computers and instantaneous e-mails, letter writing seems a bit quaint to most people, an activity of yesteryear. But I never see it that way. I have always told everyone I can write much better than I can speak. Sometimes when I need to discuss a serious subject with a friend, I find it easier just to sit down and write a letter. With a letter, you have time to reflect on the issue at hand, mull over the precise words to use, and eliminate the constant need to keep the conversation going. Letters are permanent things—they don't vanish into the air like the spoken word. If someone pays you a compliment in a letter, you can save it for when you need it.

I don't type letters. As much as I love computers for their many advantages, typing seems so impersonal. Everyone uses Times or Helvetica to aid the reader in legibility. But letters don't need to have every word be understood—they speak for themselves. You can tell more about someone by their handwriting than printed papers. For instance, my Welsh pen pal would always adorn her curvy handwriting with doodles in the margins, something you couldn't do on a computer. Besides, question marks and exclamation points are so much more effective in handwritten form.

My letter-writing ability has carried over into other aspects of my life. At the end of the year, everyone wants me to sign their yearbook, for I am able to recount the private jokes I've shared with my classmates better than most. People are delighted to receive my postcards, even when I have spent only a weekend in Lake Tahoe, because I don't waste space telling them the lake is beautiful and wishing they were there. One time I got an eleven out of ten on an assignment from a particularly demanding teacher because the assignment was to write a letter from someone else's point of view.

I have lost pen pals over the years. Cate didn't write me for a while and then wrote back recently, describing in detail how she'd gotten drunk at a Creed concert. I felt as if she had become a different person than the girl I grew to know through letters and didn't write back. The elderly lady died a few months ago, and I still cry when I come across cat note cards of hers, filled with her distinctive cursive handwriting. My Welsh pen pal had family problems and never wrote back, no matter how many letters I sent her, pleading for a response, even a short one. (Her mom even stopped writing to my mom.) But I've kept a lot of them, and added some new ones. I am dreading next year a bit, considering how many friends I will want to write long letters to, even though most of them will probably send me only mass e-mails. But I know I will never join their ranks, for letters have allowed me to discover more about myself and other people than any activity ever has. My letters I could never throw away.www.cracksat.net

"Jot a note to your future roommate relating a personal experience that reveals something about you.

The rusted ball rests in my hand. My sandals shift in the gravel. My right arm lies loosely at my side, swinging gently. I'm crouched near the ground, concentrating on a little wooden ball ten yards away. I pull my arm back, then swing it forward as my body rises. The heavy ball flies away in a gentle parabola, and scatters pebbles when it lands with a thud…right next to the wooden ball. ""Oui!"" I exclaim as I do a little jig.

What am I doing? I'm playing the classic French game of Pétanque. The goal is to get as many of your balls as close to the wooden ball (""cochonnet"") as you can. I play Pétanque every summer, when I visit my family in France. Simple as it may seem, Pétanque is actually quite complex. Over time, it has taught me about myself and others. There are two shots in Pétanque. The first is a ""pointé,"" where the player tries to place his ball near the cochonnet. The second is a ""tir,"" where the goal is to displace an opponent's ball. Some people, like my brother, win by using a ""tir."" I have always been a ""pointé"" shooter. I'd much rather quietly place my ball in a prime location than push others out of the way. A ""tir"" is all power and little accuracy, while a ""pointé"" is the exact opposite. However, both shooters are needed for a great team. If you're a ""pointé"" person, then we've already got something in common. If you're not, let's play Pétanque!www.cracksat.net

Overall, this essay has potential but it needs significant improvement to truly stand out. The essay scores a 60 out of 100, as it effectively describes a personal experience but falls short in crafting a compelling narrative that reveals something unique about the writer.

One strength of this essay is the use of vivid imagery and sensory details in the opening paragraph. The reader can easily visualize the scene and get a sense of the writer's excitement in playing Pétanque. This creates a good hook that draws the reader in.

However, the essay falls short in connecting the personal experience of playing Pétanque to the writer's character or qualities. It merely explains the rules of the game and the writer's preference for one type of shot over another. While this information is interesting, it doesn't reveal anything deep or meaningful about the writer as an individual. The essay lacks reflection and fails to dig deeper into why the writer has this preference or how it reflects their personality, values, or aspirations.

To make this essay truly memorable, the writer should focus on their personal growth or a defining moment that occurred while playing Pétanque. Did they learn something about themselves, such as their resilience, patience, or ability to strategize? Did they experience a setback or challenge that shaped their character and taught them an important life lesson?

The essay also lacks a clear structure. It feels like a sequence of disconnected thoughts rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve this, the writer should consider structuring the essay in a way that follows a logical progression. They can start with the initial fascination or curiosity about Pétanque, then delve into the experience of playing the game and the insights gained, and finally, conclude by connecting these insights to their broader life or aspirations.

Additionally, the essay could benefit from incorporating more personal anecdotes or specific examples. By providing specific instances of their experiences with Pétanque, the writer can add depth and make the essay more engaging. They should also consider using dialogue or quotes from their family members or fellow players to bring the experience to life and add authenticity to their narration.

In terms of writing style, the essay is generally clear and concise. However, the writer could work on varying their sentence structure and using more descriptive and engaging language to create a stronger impact. They should also eliminate unnecessary phrases or ideas that distract from the main focus of the essay. 

To improve the essay, here are concrete suggestions:

1. Reflect on the personal growth or insights gained from playing Pétanque. Connect these insights to your character, values, or aspirations.

2. Structure the essay in a logical progression, starting with the initial fascination for Pétanque, then delving into the experience and insights gained, and concluding with the broader implications for your life.

3. Provide specific anecdotes or examples to add depth and engage the reader.

4. Incorporate dialogue or quotes from family members or fellow players to make the essay more engaging and authentic.

5. Vary sentence structure and use descriptive language to create a stronger impact.

By implementing these improvements, the writer can transform their personal statement into a compelling narrative that truly reveals something unique about them."
"Don't you just hate those days where you find the perfect outfit, but don't have the right pair of shoes to complete the look? For me, deciding what shoes to sport depends upon which facet of my personality I wish to reveal or activity I'm about to partake in. Each day I face a dilemma—do I show the flashy, fun side or the conservative, chic side? When viewed compositely my eclectic shoe collection seems to create a convoluted image; but in reality they each represent an important component of my character. In order to better understand me, you have to simply look through my shoes. For instance, my saddle oxfords are not in the closet because I think they're stylish; no, they're here because they are a mandatory article of my school uniform. However, certain aspects of the shoes reveal much about my identity. As a student at Saint Mary's Hall becomes a senior, they experience the tradition of receiving their blue ties. This blue color represents the leadership and importance of being a senior, and therefore I wear this badge of leadership and connection to historical tradition in the form of my blue shoelaces. Other interesting shoes are my cowboy boots, since, of course, every Texan must own a pair of cowboy boots! These reflect the rugged nature of my personality, one that isn't afraid of ranch work or attending country dances with my friends.This infuses southern flavor and shows yet another dimensional and integral part of my persona.

Extracurricular activities, readily apparent in my volleyball shoes and dance shoes, also play a large part in my character. The scuffed volleyball shoes look worn from seasons of use and reflect my ongoing passion for the sport, which I've played since I was five. My variety of dance shoes reflects the different dances I've done—ballet, jazz, Flamenco, Irish. Ever since beginning to dance in order to entertain my family at the age of three, dancing has become an important and defining trait of my identity, as can be seen by my collection of dance shoes. The final important part of my character is the fun and exciting side that appears during the weekends. My pumps and complicated strap shoes show the vivacious girl who enjoys mingling and socializing. Serving as a stark contrast to the flashy footwear, my clogs depict a person who enjoys comfort. Much of my time is spent in them, testament to my personality—despite having a busy and engaging life in many different ways I always find time to relax and enjoy life! A typical day progresses as I put on the saddle oxfords for school, changing into the dance shoes for dance during the day, prepare for volleyball practice with athletic shoes, and finally returning home to embrace the comfortable confines of my clogs. As you can see I utilize many of these shoes on a daily basis as I partake in different activities and show a variety of aspects of my personality.www.cracksat.net

Score: 70/100

Strengths:
- The essay has a unique and creative approach to showcasing the applicant's personality.
- The use of various types of shoes as metaphors for different facets of the applicant's character is clever and memorable.
- The inclusion of personal anecdotes and experiences adds depth to the essay.

Areas of concern:
1. Lack of focus: While the essay starts with the idea of using shoes to represent different aspects of the applicant's personality, it goes off on tangents discussing unrelated topics, such as school traditions and Texan culture. This lack of focus weakens the overall impact of the essay and dilutes the central message.

2. Overuse of clichés: The essay relies heavily on clichés, such as ""connecting to historical tradition"" and ""every Texan must own a pair of cowboy boots."" These phrases come across as generic and uninspired, detracting from the originality of the shoe metaphor.

3. Lack of reflection and self-awareness: The essay describes the applicant's activities and interests, but fails to provide meaningful insights or reflections on how these experiences have shaped their character. The essay would benefit from delving deeper into the applicant's motivations, growth, and lessons learned from their extracurricular activities.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Focus on the central theme: The essay should remain focused on the idea of using shoes as a metaphor for the applicant's personality. Remove any unrelated tangents or details that do not directly contribute to this theme. This will help create a more cohesive and impactful narrative.

2. Avoid clichés: Instead of relying on generic statements, strive for more personal and specific details. For example, instead of mentioning that ""every Texan must own a pair of cowboy boots,"" share a specific experience or memory that showcases the applicant's connection to Texan culture.

3. Reflect on experiences: For each type of shoe mentioned, take the opportunity to reflect on how that experience or activity has shaped the applicant's character. This will help add depth and substance to the essay. Explain the challenges faced, lessons learned, and personal growth experienced through each activity.

4. Strengthen the conclusion: The conclusion should tie back to the central theme of the essay and leave a lasting impression on the reader. Consider highlighting the overarching message or lesson learned from the essay and providing a thought-provoking ending that leaves the reader with a sense of the applicant's character.

Overall, this essay has potential, but it requires refinement and a stronger focus on the applicant's personal growth and reflection. With these improvements, it has the potential to become a memorable and impactful personal statement."
"Every first Thursday of each month I always look around the Van Muren Hall gymnasium looking at the sixty- and seventy-year-old men and wonder what I am doing there with them. They have lived through world-shaping events like World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, yet I sit there and interact with them as if there were no differences at all. The reason? We simply share a similar hobby. For the last four years, I've built rubber-band-powered balsa airplanes alongside many of these old timers. It began in eighth grade, when I was randomly selected to be the model airplane builder for my Science Olympiad team for the event known as The Wright Stuff. In this event a competitor builds a tissue-covered, balsa plane to achieve a ""best flight time."" I was quite hesitant at the outset due to my lack of knowledge about the subject, but decided to forge ahead in order to help my team. In a stroke of good fortune, I stumbled over a phone number at a nearby hobby shop for the captain of the local flying club. After a simple call and meeting, I started working with my mentor, Chris Borland, a retired man of about sixty years of age.

I have never been a very dexterous person. When I was younger I engaged in sports activities and played with action figures, forever imagining new adventures. I never played with Legos or blocks like many other children which might have enhanced hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Plane building requires many minute changes of details that only calm, nimble, and patient hands can make. None of which I have. Numerous times I broke a plane by sanding too roughly or glued my fingers together while really trying to glue two pieces of wood. Most of these events ended with my driving an X-ACTO knife into my building board and a shout of expletives. Not until recently could I claim that I can adeptly use my hands. I have needed to take my time to build planes, gluing the pieces ever so precisely and making everything perfect. At first I was frustrated with myself since my mentor would finish a plane in four hours and it would take me twice as long, but he had also been building planes since he was a child. After realizing this, I became more accepting of the time and patience needed to build planes and began to allot a greater amount of time for building. Instead of doing fast, shoddy jobs, I sacrificed my regular basketball television viewing time and replaced it with spending more time building planes and perfecting my techniques. I also endured long nights to finish planes the same day I started, hoping to limit the variables such as humidity that could skew the structure while having to concentrate even more because of my fatigue.

This last year I spent more than fifty hours constructing four working planes for the regional, state, and national Science Olympiad competitions. I say ""working"" because I constructed many more planes, however only four were perfect enough for the competition; the others were abandoned. Through all this work, I almost gave up after the regional competition due to a horrific showing. My two best planes simply did not take off the ground as the balsa wheels got stuck in the carpeted floor of the Grand Ballroom at California State University at Sacramento. Finally, after my second failed flight I took the plane, sat down, and cried. I hated my plane. I hated myself for failing both my team and myself.

In retrospect it was this failure and embarrassment that became my motivation for the rest of the year. Constantly remembering that rare emotional breakdown and failure of my airplane to even lift off the ground, I was fueled to do better. I pledged myself that I would not fail again! I spent days and nights building planes, scrapping them if there was even a minor flaw. Finally, I rebuilt a plane, tested it, and took it to the national competition. My life, my self worth, and my pride were all tied up in this mixture of balsa wood and tissue paper. Upon arriving at the competition site I froze in fear when I noticed the carpeted surface that covered the center of the Ohio State University indoor track. Trembling, I tried to focus,remembering what my mentor said before I left Sacramento. ""Just have fun."" Recalling those three simple words cleared my head of doubt and fear and also cleansed my soul as I then casually strolled out onto the carpeted area and flew my plane. It stayed up for four minutes and nineteen seconds, twice as long as any of my planes have ever flown! I was elated and felt vindicated when I placed sixth in the national competition and was awarded a bronze medal.

Tackling this odd, anachronistic hobby has changed my life in many ways beyond doing well in the national competition. Studying and receiving good grades have always come fairly easily for me and it wasn't until this challenge that I learned to persevere and at the same time be patient and calm under pressure. My hands never seemed skillful enough and my luck never seemed to be there at the right time. I had to overcome many failures, but in the end,everything came together.www.cracksat.net

"Of the activities, interests, and experiences listed on the previous page, which is the most meaningful to you, and why?

My coach always tells me that there is some reason why we, as debaters, can take four weeks out of our summer vacation, away from our friends and our families, to enclose ourselves in lecture halls and cramped dorm rooms to learn the depths and intricacies of debate. He has never told me what this reason is, but now that I'm beginning my senior year and I have attended three of these camps, I think I finally understand why. Debate, by definition, is simply a discussion over opposing view points. So what makes it so interesting? What makes it meaningful? Simply, it acts as a forum and a gateway into realms of discussion you would never encounter otherwise. No other activity exists where individuals of any age, any ethnicity, any background, any height, weight, sex, or color can voice their opinions on an equal playing field.

Debate has also affected me in other ways; I can't tell you how many times I get in debates with my father over controversial topics such as abortion, gay marriage, stem cell research, etc. These conversations, although intense and often times frustrating, allow me to understand the assumptions my father makes, and often they provide me insight into my father's adolescence. I can trace his beliefs back to their root causes, and this ability has allowed me to finally understand what makes my father tick. Being able to argue with somebody over opposing viewpoints allows you to create amazing relationships, whether they are

friendships or rivalries. I value my relationships inside the debate community as my strongest. Finally, I think debate emphasizes and improves the art of conversation; debate acts as a retreat from the daily discussions of, ""Dude did you see my new Mercedes?"" and, ""Oh my gosh, did you see The O.C. last night?"" and it expands our communication into deeper, more thought-provoking interactions. So when somebody asks me, ""Why do you go to debate camp?"" I simply smile, shrug my shoulders, and talk, until they can hear no more.www.cracksat.net

"When I was ten years old, I met Vince Lombardi. I saw him at the post office. He was sitting quietly with George Marshall and Humphrey Bogart. Vince cast a triumphant smile in my direction. His excitement was so contagious that I could not help smiling with him. Mr. Marshall, however, seemed to stare right through me. His solemn gaze conveyed little more than that he had very important things on his mind. Then I looked to Humphrey Bogart, who, with a suave movement, simply cocked his head to one side, and sat there, just looking good. The three men seemed nice enough, so I took them home with me. Yes, they had all been dead for many years, but I didn't really mind. In my room, armed with a pair of tongs, I gingerly slid each of them into the slots of homemade album pages, next to stamps of bright blue jays, waving flags, bursting flowers, a crooning Elvis Presley, and scores of others, which I had acquired over the past two years.

Philately caught my attention very early in my life. My grandfather hooked me with a stamp from the 1960s that commemorated the sesquicentennial of the Erie Canal. I was drawn to the small colorful pictures like a crow is drawn to shiny objects. I started saving every stamp that I could find. The hobby quickly developed into more than a haphazard accumulation of pretty paper labels. A closer examination of each stamp revealed new cultures, new languages, new people, new geography; new worlds, each competing to quench my inherent thirst for knowledge, steering my imagination to new heights.

As a group, stamp collectors have been categorically branded as wealthy, reclusive, boring, moldy old men. However, I've been an avid philatelist since age eight, and, as a seventeen-year-old in high school, I don't fit the stereotype very well. It is true that few young people collect stamps. Though I know some exist I've never met another stamp collector my age. More often than not, my peers express disapproval for the hobby. In fact, when I told a friend that this essay would be about stamp collecting, he laughed and said, ""Man, you're going to have a tough time making that sound cool."" I pointed to a pile of trading cards on his desk and replied, ""Hey, at least I don't collect Magic cards"" (Magic is a fantasy card game similar to the Pokemon game that swept the country a few years ago). I understand how some could perceive the slow, tedious processes associated with stamp collecting, like sorting, classification, grading, and organization, as exercises in monotonous futility. I, for one, not only welcome the procedural structure of these processes, but also embrace the rare opportunity for uninterrupted solitude that accompanies them, using it to develop my patience and allow my imagination to lead me through exciting childhood realms of exploration and adventure—winning Super Bowls, rebuilding post-war Europe, making films—which are markedly absent from the high school experience.

I don't think I will ever be able to make philately ""sound cool,"" but at the same time, I don't feel like I need to. It's not about being ""cool."" I'm a philatelist, because stamp collecting gives me pleasure and peace of mind.www.cracksat.net

"I can say with certainty that there is nothing that has more of a positive effect on my life than Latin. Of course other things have grabbed my interest over the years, like poetry, math, singing, and women, but my true passion is for the Classics. I never would have thought that a civilization that lived over two thousand years ago could have excited me, but I have learned that many of the problems and concerns of Classical society are still widely applicable to our modern society. For example, in Plato's Republic, Socrates seeks the true definition of justice. Just like Socrates, we could never actually put such an abstract idea into a few words, but we still seek simplicity, as Socrates did. In Classics I see the basis for the majority of Western Civilization, and I yearn to explore it further.

I stumbled into this odyssey of classical discovery that I now call my life in the seventh grade. My Latin teacher was unusually eager to urge students into participating in Latin Club. I admit that she forced me into it, but from the very first time I competed I never regretted it. In middle school, Latin filled the void in my mind that was begging me to care about something, anything, so I kept working at the Classics, hoping I could keep the void full.

After middle school, I faced the inevitable transition to high school. My transition was rocky. Austin High is a huge school where I knew only a few people. On top of my trouble fitting in at this impersonal school, I found that the Latin program at Austin High was weak. My teacher had other problems to deal with and most of my classmates were too high to care. I realized how truly blessed I had been at my middle school. I decided to take more of a leadership role in the Latin program than I had in middle school. Unlike my middle school, Austin High tended to send only two or three people to Latin conventions. I was in charge of making sure the three of us got where we had to be during conventions.

My freshman year was also the first year I won a spot on the statebound Certamen team, which became a nationals-bound Certamen team when we won out over teams from San Antonio and Houston at the State competition. In this game of buzzers that tested both thumb-speed and Classical knowledge, I excelled, and our team took Third Place at Nationals. It was at Nationals that I had a close look at the students of St. Andrew's Episcopal School. Due to necessity, I traveled to Kentucky with St. Andrew's for Nationals. It felt like I fit with them. They impressed me with how close all the students were, both with each other and with their teachers, including one that, like me, was new to their community.

By the end of that summer I knew that I wanted more than anything to be a part of the St. Andrew's community. I toured the school, but even before that I think I was decided: if at all possible I wanted to go to St. Andrew's. Thanks to the efforts of my parents and the Latin teacher I enrolled at St. Andrew's for my sophomore year, and I have never looked back. As a result of this change I started working harder in every subject at school, thus my grades went up, even in courses that were more intellectually challenging than the ones I had previously taken at Austin High. I also improved in my favorite area. At the Texas State Junior Classical League convention I was shocked to find that I had been named Texas Latin Student of the Year for having the highest score on the decathlon, a test that tested a range of subjects related to Classical civilization, such as Latin grammar, mythology, history, and literature.

My junior year was even better. Although classes were even more difficult, nevertheless I enjoyed the challenge and continued to excel. In Latin, where some thought I had little room to improve, I continued to climb. Again, I was named Texas Latin Student of the year; I got a 5 on the Catullus-Ovid Latin Literature AP; but the achievement I am most proud of came during the summer at the National Latin Convention in Richmond, Virginia. Not only did my Certamen team win first place, taking home the Maureen O'Donnell Traveling Trophy, but I had the highest score on the national decathlon, which came not only with a $500 scholarship, but also the title of Best Latin Student in the Nation. My parents, Latin teachers, and friends could not have been more proud.

Rome may have fallen 1,500 years ago, but I cannot help but think that the Classics live on. People still want to know the meaning of justice and they often consult Plato in their search. I want to find the answers in Classics like so many before me. The Classics may not have been my first love, but they will be something that will stay with me forever.www.cracksat.net

"What can you bring to the Rice community, in past experience, background, etc?

Now I was at the front of the classroom, using what little artistic coordination I had to draw a great big figure on the board: yes, those had to be eyes, an L-shaped nose, wrinkled eyebrows, a gaping ""O"" for a mouth. I added little stress lines on either corner of the cheeks, just to show how intent my hastily composed figure was on examining this ""Sylvan historian, who canst thus express a flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme.""

I sat down tentatively.""Kate,"" my English teacher said, ""I asked that the class draw the images Keats evoked inside the Grecian Urn.""

I examined the board carefully. Figures of centaurs and trees and altars and young lovers in the heat of the chase were contained within the vessel she'd sketched a few minutes earlier. My figure loomed to the right of the urn, eyes open, sort of worried-looking now that I thought about it.

The class was silent. I'd done it again. I had gotten…too creative.

""Well, Ms. Erskine,"" I started hesitantly, ""how could this urn mean so much if no one was there to observe it, to remember the history behind the 'marble men and maidens overwrought,' to imagine the 'burning forehead,' the 'parching tongue'? Who would be there to feel the woe, the 'old age that shall this generation waste'?!""

Silence, still. On top of being too creative, I'd gotten all passionate about it. My honors English class was looking at me as if I had an urn tattooed on my forehead. I prepared myself to live through it this time, just like the other times I'd gone out on a limb and fallen flat on my face, while the teacher looked at me as blankly as the students.

But suddenly, Ms. Erskine beamed. ""I was hoping someone would say that! The point of this poem is to measure not just art, but time and our own humanity….""

I had gotten lucky that day—my teacher understood me.

I have to agree with Keats that ""heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter."" My ideas are often considered unconventional; because of that I have learned to be brave, and to stand up for the way I see things. I can usually make my case, whether anyone else gets it or not. I have a commanding voice and I ask to be taken seriously. And while it is sometimes hard to risk the pride I've gathered over seventeen years for a single opinion, I get a rush when I put myself out there.

I'm always up for a challenge—be it taking an AP Biology class to a semester abroad in England, to working hands-on with a cadaver at a university summer school. It's not that I don't get scared, but being afraid motivates me to accomplish my goals. I value passion, dedication, and the quest for knowledge. My perspective is international; I find the glass ceiling of language and culture barriers easily broken, especially if you refuse to see them. Perhaps my attitude can be attributed to growing up in the most diverse city in the country; but I think it has more to do with having an open heart and big eyes.

So, if I dare to put myself in a nutshell:

I am in a ""mad pursuit"" to understand life and education and humanity in the world, believing that ""beauty is truth, truth beauty."" If you are loyal to one, you'll find both. Let me add that to the Rice community. Let me grab the moment, taste the adventure, and immerse myself in the environment of a university renowned with a love of knowledge and the pursuit of truth. I'll take on whateverburdens are necessary to keep this spark alive.","Essay Critique:

"""I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.""—Charles V

I don't speak German. Horseless, and with two cats that understand only Russian, I never had the need. Besides, languages don't fall into neat categories for me as they did for Charles. But they do have a place in my life, and recently I have come to better understand just how important a place it is. As this year's High Holidays approached, it came to me: on those days, I would be using five different languages.

I love such days. Enclosed on both ends by my native Russian—the language of my family—and founded upon my probably even more ""native"" English—the language of my friends and school—those days don't stop there. They take me through Latin at school and Hebrew at my temple, two languages with such different histories: one that went on to seed countless others and has now all but vanished, the other battered for two thousand years to near extinction and yet now the vibrant language of millions of people. Those days also feature my fairly recent and much cherished addition, Spanish, the language that lets me connect with people in a small Mexican town and in a San Diego marketplace.

Now I love those five-language days, but it has not always been that way. Years ago, even two languages seemed to be more than I could handle. Fluent in Russian at the age of two, thrown into an English-speaking world, I was confused and disoriented. How much I hated English, and a year later, when it had become my own, with what vengeance did I turn on my Russian! Only relentless and often painful pressure from my parents kept me truly bilingual through all those early years. At the time, I resented them and their demands; only later did I realize how much of a gift they had given me.

Languages are my passion and they are my life. It amazes me that, having grown up speaking English, just last summer I could still pass for a native in Russia, where I have not lived in over fifteen years. I am thrilled that I was able to study The Aeneid in its original text; deeply moved that I could read ancient Torah scrolls at my Bar Mitzvah, the first person in my family in at least three generations to do so; and excited that I was given a chance to use my Spanish to teach math, science, and drama in a volunteer program for kids from underfunded, understaffed, and often just neglected Oakland schools.

I have made the transition from resentment to love, and these days I dream about going for more. I don't know which language lies next on my path, and, luckily, I don't have to make that decision now. But I do know that this is the path I want to take—through college and beyond, into my career and into my future. Should I explore Italian or Portuguese? French or Catalan? Maybe even German? Well, in that case, I'd better start saving up for a horse.www.cracksat.net

"The famous Greek mathematician archimedes once said, ""give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."" The basic principle of a lever is that as the length of a lever increases, the effort needed to be exerted to accomplish a task decreases. This fundamental law can also apply to life. Life's levers are experiences and opportunities that combine to motivate the individual to succeed. However, a lever is useless when forced upon an incorrectly placed fulcrum. Fulflling oneself with passion and values is to build and place a strong and stable fulcrum. Without a passion for success, these opportunities and experiences become obsolete. Few fnd the correct balance between these variables and thus fail to reach their full potential. I, however, plan to be someone who fnds that balance.

In an effort to build a successful lever for myself, I have searched for these experiences and opportunities all of my life. I have always had a passion for learning and a natural drive to succeed. At the beginning of my sophomore year in high school, I began to volunteer at a local, family owned zoo. This idea came from an innate passion for animals and an ongoing interest in science. At frst, it was simply to complete a community service graduation requirement, but soon thereafter, I realized it was so much more. Work there was not like what most zoo volunteers experience. When other volunteers were following zookeepers and watching animals through cages at larger commercial zoos, I was spending nights ""monkeysitting"" my supervisor's newborn Japanese snow macaque. However, calling it work solely alludes to labor. It was more of a life-altering, unique opportunity and provided me with the experience that clenched my decision to major in animal science.

Along with my passion for animals, I am also always looking for ways to challenge myself intellectually. I am an active member of my school's Envirothon and Math teams and a Science Olympiad competitor. After high school, it has always been a goal of mine to attend an academically competitive university. A few years of researching brought me to Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). After attending the CALS open house and information lecture on the animal science department, I knew it was the perfect ft. One of the reoccurring themes of my conversations with students and professors alike was CALS dedication to shaping students into leaders.

With the experience I have gained in working at the zoo, I see myself emerging as a natural leader. Leaders are those few who do manage to balance the use of their ""lever and fulcrum."" In high school, I also have worked my way to positions such as; nHS President, Steel Drums Ensemble President, and Student representative to the School Board. Leadership roles like these are not something I plan to make the past after high school. In a school like CALS that has so many extracurricular activities to get involved in, I am sure obtaining positions similar to the ones I hold now would not be diffcult. One of the clubs that I have seriously explored is the Pre-vet Society. veterinary School is something that I plan to pursue after college and hope to get involved in at the undergraduate level.

The building of a successful lever has only just begun for me. There is still so much that I have not seen or done. Life is full of opportunities that can lead to great experiences, one of my greatest being volunteering at the Woodland Zoo. With all of the opportunities CALS has to offer, if given the chance to attend, I am certain that I would utilize every one; becoming not only an active member of the university, but a leader of tomorrow.www.cracksat.net

"Everyone knows that it takes both hard work and a good understanding of the subject in order to complete a project. However, I never appreciated the other academic strengths and personal qualities needed until my 11th grade physics fnal. The task was to create an energy conversion machine that would undergo a minimum of fve energy conversions. The construction of the machine piqued my interest in pursuing an engineering career and later became the pivotal factor in my decision to apply to Caltech.

I knew from the beginning that it would be a challenge to complete just the minimum requirements for the project. Believing that my teammates and I had the ability and potential to do better, as the team leader, I made it our goal to cover the conversions of all eight energy types that were taught in class. I also strived to add into the machine a bonus feature of breaking an egg. Struggling to fnd a solution for breaking the egg, I refected upon the force of gravity we had learned. This idea led to a trap-door mechanism that would allow the egg to fall under gravity and break upon impact.

In addition to excelling in math and the sciences, I am also a strong visual art student. Enjoying drawing and designing, I gained a different perspective that I may not have had as just a science student. The creativity and imagination from the visual arts allowed me to use toilet paper rolls, Styrofoam, and Popsicle sticks as the primary materials to construct the machine in a limited space within limited time. Together with good planning, coordination, and the ability to work in a team, my innovative perspective from visual arts made this project a success.On the due date, I watched with a prideful glee as the machine operated smoothly. For going beyond the minimum requirements, the machine was very well received. Beyond earning an excellent grade, the challenge of completing this project intrigued my increasing interest in engineering. My expectations and goals as a future college student were also evolved during the process.

Certain that I wanted to become a professional in the engineering feld, I began searching for a college that would provide me with an excellent academic and hands-on experience. While I knew that Caltech is a prestigious science and engineering school, it wasn't until I received the Caltech Signature Award that I developed a stronger interest in becoming a Techer. Upon further research, I realized that Caltech is the college for me.

At Caltech, my engineering aspirations will be realized in this challenging, research-integrated environment. The rigorous coursework and the generous research opportunities at Caltech will provide the challenge I need to achieve my goal of becoming an engineer. In return, I believe the combination of my academic strength and creative personal characteristics will defnitely contribute to Caltech and help to add to the interdisciplinary atmosphere of the school.

It takes more than just hard work to succeed as an engineering professional. However, it can be achieved with the outstanding educational opportunity at Caltech and with my other academic strengths and personal qualities.www.cracksat.net

"One of Stanford's essay prompts is to provide a photo and explain its signifcance.

I once belonged to royalty, strolling along the lush pastures of grass and enormous spires of renaissance structure. Unfortunately, I was not given a crown on my voyage, even though I felt the crown when visiting the grand castle in Spain. The picture shown is important to me not only because of the spectacular view, but it also represents my passions for the study of Spain's cultural history and literature as well as how those subjects offer clues to discovering my individuality.

Traveling to Spain gave me the chance of a lifetime to explore its history with respect to my personality. In the photograph, the castle in the background once belonged to the great royal unifers of Spain named Ferdinand and Isabella. With their process of unifcation came the exploration of the Americas. Explorers such as Christopher Columbus established Spanish territories in the new World, such as Colombia, which is the country my parents are from, and I was born. From this chain of causality, Spain's history essentially created my existence. Pondering about my historical background from Spain, perhaps I would have never been born if the king and queen never unifed Spain. I could be speaking Arabic if the expulsion of the Moors never occurred under the hands of the Spanish monarchs. Curiously, I could have been born as an Indian native, because the new World would have never been explored. Perhaps, I wouldn't be looking at the same photo, explaining its signifcance! Frankly, exploring Spain's history has enabled me to discover my origins. When viewing the picture through my point of view, I see myself returning the roots of my creation.

Spain also offers a vibrant history of literary works and signifcant innovations in Hispanic literature. Similar to the exploration of history leading to a clue for learning about myself, I have the ability to explore the literature the Hispanic culture has to offer. Knowing two languages allows me to discover the essence of ideas authors such as gabriel garcía Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges, and Cervantes wanted to convey to their audience. Since language is to a code for ideas, I can decipher two different kinds of codes, English and Spanish, to understand the author's emotions placed into his or her literature. Spanish literature also enhances Hispanic culture as a positive infuence in the world. Reading literature in Spanish and English consequently has allowed me to further search for clues about my cultural origins, since Spanish literature is considered a voice among the people.

Perhaps my interest in these two subjects came from knowing I come from a Colombian family. I am the frst in our family to be born in the United States, and as a result, I represent two different cultures. Knowing I come from a culturally different family, I feel passionate about exploring my family's cultural roots because it is a method to discover clues about my individuality, as well as the origins of my family. In the USA, the last names of Aguado or granados are rarely found among common Americans. When I traveled to Spain, I purchased wooden plaques showing the coat of arms from my ancestors bearing the Aguado and granados names. When I found these plaques commemorating my family, I had felt I found yet another clue to my personality, since my last names were found from Spain (similar to fnding a needle in a haystack). Finding my coat of arms on my trip proves my origins lie within the history and culture of Spain. The trip to Spain gave me the opportunity to explore my existence as a human being, as well as knowing from where I came.

Based on my perceptions, my picture represents to me the complex evolution of my personality, since I am constantly fnding new clues leading to the understanding of who I am. This picture is a part of my constant search for my individuality and is a reminder of the beginning of my personal exploration. This is my crown.www.cracksat.net

Source Url:https://www.cracksat.net/college-admission/essays/109.html","Overall, I would rate this essay a 70. It effectively captures the significance of the photo and how it relates to the writer's personal journey, but there are areas that could be improved to make it more compelling and memorable.

Strengths:
- The essay does a good job of connecting the photo to the writer's passions for the study of Spain's cultural history and literature. It shows a clear interest and understanding of the subject matter.
- The writer effectively uses the photo as a launching point to explore their own personal background and origins. This adds depth to the essay and makes it more personal and introspective.
- The essay has a clear structure and flows logically from one point to the next. It is easy to follow the writer's train of thought.
- The writer's enthusiasm for their heritage and exploration of their cultural roots comes through in the essay. This passion adds to the overall impact of the piece.

Weaknesses:
- The essay could benefit from more vivid and descriptive language. It often reads as flat and lacks sensory details that could enhance the reader's engagement.
- There is some repetition in the essay, particularly in regards to the writer's exploration of their cultural origins. While this is an important point, it could be condensed to avoid redundancy.
- The introduction could be more compelling. It sets the stage for the essay but doesn't immediately grab the reader's attention or make them curious to continue reading.
- The essay would benefit from more specific examples and anecdotes to illustrate the writer's points. This would help the reader to better understand and connect with the writer's experiences.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Consider starting the essay with a more attention-grabbing introduction. Start with an anecdote, a vivid description, or a thought-provoking question to immediately engage the reader.
- Use more descriptive language throughout the essay to paint a clearer picture for the reader. For example, instead of simply mentioning the castle in the background of the photo, describe the grandeur and beauty of the castle and how it made the writer feel.
- Instead of repeating the idea of exploring cultural origins multiple times, focus on one or two key experiences or discoveries that had a significant impact on the writer's understanding of their identity.
- Provide specific examples and anecdotes to support the writer's points. For example, instead of mentioning the wooden plaques commemorating the writer's family, describe the moment when they found the plaques and how it made them feel connected to their heritage.

By addressing these areas of improvement, the essay could become a more compelling and memorable piece that stands out to admissions officers. Keep revising and refining the essay to ensure it reflects the writer's unique perspective and makes a lasting impression."
"You've given me one more page to tell you about myself. Just one. There are only eight boxes for extra-curricular activities, only three lines to tell about my summers, just over two inches to write a note to my future roommate, and only one page to fll in all the holes, to color in all the blank space. Unfortunately both for me and for you, entire lives don't ft into boxes and personalities can't be completely sketched on paper. I have to do my best to show you who I am, and you have to do your best to fnd me in all this black ink. So, best of luck to you. As for me, I will write just one more page and hope it gives you a clearer image of who I really am.

You have noticed, I'm sure, my list of extra-curricular activities. What you can't see is the struggle that went into compiling that list. For one thing, my practice list was comprised of far more than eight activities, so I was forced to group things together and to leave things out. Every summer and winter, I travel with my youth group on a service trip, sometimes within this country, other times around the world.

The summer before my freshman year and again two years later, we spent two weeks in Costa rica, living with families there and working both helping build a renovation on a church there and playing with children in a refugee settlement called Pavas. The year in between, we ran a day camp for underprivileged children in San Antonio, Texas, and the summer before my junior year, we did various kinds of service in Columbus, Ohio. For our winter trips, we have done urban outreach in new York City and in Miami, trying to use those experiences to help our downtown church improve its outreach ministries. My service experience with church goes beyond these trips twice a year, though. I spend several evenings each year volunteering in the homeless shelter in my church's gym both with youth group and with my family. We also go as a family each year early on Christmas morning to serve breakfast at the shelter and celebrate the holiday with the guests. These are pieces of the categories I call ""Central Presbyterian Church youth group"" and ""Community Service"" that I didn't have space for in the box, but that mean a lot to me and play huge roles in my life.

Another experience that I haven't found a space for is the Maine Coast Semester, the four months I spent on Chewonki neck in Maine during the fall of my junior year. Although my essay provides one snapshot of the experience, it cannot possibly speak to everything the semester meant to me. Moving out of my family's house and into a cabin with six girls my own age was extremely exciting for me, and what I found when I got there was even better than what I had expected.

It was a place I could relate to. In science class, we would learn to identify the trees and wildlife that were living just outside our cabins. In the afternoon, working on the farm, we would lovingly tend the animals and plants that we would then harvest, prepare in the kitchen, and eat. Each of us realized our connection to every other member of the Chewonki community and to the land itself, and learned to be responsible with that connection. When I was assigned to collect recyclables before breakfast for my morning chore, I showed up just as promptly and with just as much energy as when my chore was to milk the cows or to clean the bathrooms. Similarly, when a teacher asked me to read an assignment for homework, I got it done, not simply because I wanted to keep a good grade, but because the entire class depended on each person's individual preparation in order to have rich, meaningful discussion.

Coming home, I realized that here, too, I was connected to my community. Although it is larger than the one in Maine, I still have the same responsibility to those around me, and will have that responsibility to whatever community I am part of for the rest of my life. In my daily life, just like on my service trips, I try to look for chances to beneft something greater than myself. In college, I look forward to becoming part of a new community, and fguring out how to fnd my niche, so that I can serve that community as well as be served by it.www.cracksat.net

"Becasue I find life's intricacy so amazing, biology and its related subjects are the most enjoyable topics for me. Within biology our brains interest me the most, which—with their countless neurons and chemicals—give us unmatched emotion, uniqueness, and potential.

Due to the possibilities of understanding emotions and mental problems from their source, I'd like to develop a great understanding of neuroscience, and use it to help people overcome diseases and mental barriers as a doctor, allowing them to achieve the highest possible quality of life.

Brown University would also give me the greatest ability to help people. With their deep community involvement and famous neuroscience department, I would have an outstanding opportunity to help people as I develop the utmost understanding of neurology. The open curriculum will also bring me more benefts. The ability to study multiple languages and social sciences will help me interact and exchange ideas with fewer limits. Moreover, the curriculum will allow me to be come an outstanding scientist. The way in which this could help me scientifcally is best summarized in the words of my biology professor at Kent State University: ""One of our major inhibiting factors in addressing more complicated issues of science is that scientists need to have a sweeping grasp of multiple disciplines such as psychology, biology, convention physics, and quantum physics. And if that wasn't bad enough, you're going to need amazing writing skills to convey your ideas to other people and seem credible."" I don't necessarily expect to achieve full mastery in the four or fve years I spend as an undergraduate, but I believe Brown is where I'll have the best opportunity to advance in these areas. To expand even more, the open curriculum would allow me to surround myself with individuals that are just as passionate about languages and sciences as I am. With these classmates I would love to have great conversations and even participate in research. Attending Brown University will bring me all of these things, which will aid me in becoming the best doctor and scientist I can possibly be.www.cracksat.net

"The buzzing of the alarm clock suddenly stops and, to my surprise, I am awakened not by the noise but by the silence, rudely jerked from my sleep. Six forty-fve, the numbers read. I pull my comforter tighter under my chin and close my eyes, fully intending to get up in a few minutes. I'm sure I'll wake back up in a few minutes, but not yet. I can't do it yet.

""Lolo!"" someone's whispering to me, in my dreams I'm sure. ""Lolo, get up! Aren't you coming?"" Coming where? One instant of confusion. Only one blissful instant, and then it all makes sense. It's Saturday.""Yeah, I'm coming."" The listlessness of my voice surprises me. I groan and fold the thick layers of blankets off of me. The frigid December air pounces. As I watch, thousands of tiny bumps germinate on my arms, and the fne hairs stand alarmingly straight. After getting out of bed and pulling on my bathing suit, I eagerly throw my winter coat around my arms and shoulders. I debate crawling back in my bed. no one said I had to do it.

I look at my cabinmates, and I push that thought from my mind. Although Lucy and Tuna stay nestled in their beds, Cara is pulling a sweatshirt over her head. Emily and Constanza are standing quietly, fully dressed, and Sarah is duct-taping a pair of fip-fops on her bare feet. Shoes. I had almost forgotten. I open the door, and look down at our tiny porch. My tennis shoes are indeed there, frozen solid. I force the unyielding layers of ice around my feet, wincing. The laces crunch, and small crystals of ice fall gently to the foor as I tie a bow on each shoe. Everyone is ready. It's time to go.

I wrap my arm through Constanza's as we step off the last wooden step from the cabin. The air isn't so bad out here--probably a few degrees above zero. My feet begin to tingle and then to burn. We trudge through the snow as quickly as possible, and I'm sure my excitement is visible on my face.

Soon, we can see the water of the Sheepscot river, stained with thin sheets of ice. Most people would say we're out of our minds. My friends back in Atlanta will call me crazy. I grin. Squeezing Constanza's hand on one side and Emily's on the other, I stumble through the mud left by the receding tide.

""One, two, three!"" We count together and sprint into the icy water, diving under the surface just for an instant. As we clamber out of the water and toward our chilled towels, our semester-mates cheer wildly. The next threesome heads toward the water.

Later in the morning, the thirty-six students at Maine Coast Semester fle into the dining hall for breakfast, about twenty of us dripping wet and beaming. Five of us sport shorts and sunglasses in a foolish attempt to defy the cold. I follow my friends to a table where a large book stands open, and sign my name under the heading ""Polar Bears: December 7."" As I sit eating my bagel, I catch the eye of a wet-headed polar bear across the room and we smile together.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 65/100

Strengths:
- The essay vividly captures the protagonist's internal thoughts and feelings, making for a personal and engaging narrative.
- The use of descriptive language, such as ""frigid December air pounces"" and ""tiny bumps germinate on my arms,"" adds depth and imagery to the writing.
- The essay effectively conveys the protagonist's excitement and willingness to step out of their comfort zone.

Areas of Concern:
- The introduction lacks a clear thesis or overarching purpose, making it challenging to fully grasp the essay's focus. Providing a strong and concise thesis statement would help guide the reader and establish a clear direction for the essay.
- The narrative appears fragmented and lacks a clear progression. The abrupt transition from being awakened by silence to deciding to jump into icy water feels disjointed and could benefit from smoother transitions.
- The essay would benefit from exploring the protagonist's motivations and reflections on their actions in more depth. This would help to provide insight into their character and make the essay more meaningful.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Introduce a clear thesis statement in the opening paragraph to provide focus and direction for the essay. This could be something like, ""This essay explores my experience participating in a daring winter activity and the lessons in daringness and community it taught me.""
2. Revise the transitions between different moments in the narrative to create a more cohesive and logical flow. For example, consider adding a sentence or two to bridge the gap between waking up and deciding to jump into the icy water, explaining the thought process and motivations behind the decision.
3. Take the time to reflect on the significance of the experience and its impact on personal growth. Consider adding paragraphs that delve into the protagonist's thoughts and emotions before, during, and after the experience. This reflection will add depth and meaning to the narrative.

Remember to continue revising and refining the essay to ensure that the necessary changes are made. Good luck with your college application!"
"The quick ripping of thick tape and the heavy thuds of cardboard boxes echo throughout an empty, unfamiliar, and lonely house. As the heavy boxes are slowly opened and their contents revealed, my young heart jumps for joy. There, within that scant and unexpectedly durable shell of cardboard, lie my invaluable possessions. After removing the bubbly layer of protection from my valuables, I begin to place them, one by one, onto my familiar, yet strangely new shelf.

I frst lift out my ragged and faithful stuffed animal Mr. Teddy. Though torn, dirty and missing his left eye, he reminds me of my youth and the one constant friendship in my life. He has traveled with me thousands upon thousands of miles to and from each of the seven vastly different living experiences that have defned my life. Mr. Teddy has been there with me throughout the diffculty of every one of the transitions in my life.

next, I pull out a small, fragile lamp decorated with blue and white pinstripes. A small yellow duck lives at the bottom of the glass compartment. As I fumble with the rotating switch, I see that only two of the three different settings are properly working. now, after years of travel, only the nightlight and brightest setting work. I leave the light on at its brightest setting and place it on my night table. The brightness comforts me.

I return to the box to pull out my thick, denim blue journal and my favorite ink pen. I fip through the pages, pausing to glance at my informal collection of favorite pictures of friends, articles, and tidbits of memories that I have compiled through the stages in my life. I open to the last section of the book and glance at my favorite quotations alphabetically sorted by subject and author. I look up Woody Allen and smile at his ridiculously funny honesty and place my journal on the ledge next to my window.

After refueling my ink pen I scoop up my carefully packaged rosary and Bible. As I crack open the case, the pearl white beads of my rosary glint in the sunlight and my ivory covered Bible, given to me on my First Communion, opens to the front page. There, written in my aunt's handwriting, is a greeting written in Spanish and signed by my now deceased grandparents. These two items represent one of my only connections to my relatives and the history of my family in Colombia: a common religion and a belief in Providence.

After saying a quick prayer of thanksgiving I pull out my fnal and most necessary possession. The dust fies off the glass as I blow across the surface. There, under the grime of travel, lies my own face fxed in time. Enclosed within a light maple frame, a color photograph captures my eleven year old self clothed in bright purple soccer shorts and a white sleeveless uniform shirt. My hair is tightly pulled back in the quintessential ponytail, sweat dripping off my skin and dirt covering my socks. My face is frozen in an expression of relief, domination, and triumph after scoring the game-winning goal in the merciless sun of a Houston summer. I study the image and wipe a single tear from my eye. My knee aches sympathetically, and I prepare to hang the picture. As I pick up the hammer, I realize that although soccer is no longer a part of my life, I have flled the vacancy in my heart with other challenging and signifcant activities that I have grown to love with the same fervor. That picture, though simple, encompasses the passion that is my life. It will forever symbolize for me the love and dedication I have for everything I do.

With a last glance, I hang the heavy frame on the wall. The box is empty, unlike the room. Although the room is only flled by a few items, it is occupied by the only items I will ever need for the rest of my life: friendship, humility, self-expression, family, god, and passion.www.cracksat.net

Strengths:
- The essay creates a vivid and tangible image of the author's personal belongings and their significance.

- The inclusion of personal anecdotes and memories adds depth to the essay.

Areas of Concern:

"I stood behind the curtains listenign to the applause to the previous act. I exhaled, realizing that this was a moment that fulflled my childhood wish. Tonight was special because instead of an alto aria or a jazz lick, I had prepared a song unique to my identity. I curled my fngers around the microphone and waited impatiently as the curtains opened.

My love for performance stemmed from my appreciation of music as a child. In the city in China where I spent the frst ten years of my life, I never found a choir to join and never laid eyes on a grand piano. nonetheless, I treasured my passion for song and sought ways to bring music into my life. I sang with our old record player when I was barely tall enough to reach it. On certain afternoons, my best friend and I would tape bed sheets to the ceiling as curtains and invite neighbors to come listen. There, we sang in duet, danced, and bowed while clasping each other's hands. Captured in our own musical sanctuary, we never noticed the hours that passed by.

Music evokes in me the emotions that words and pictures cannot. I also revel in the intellectual challenges that music offers. I fnd it thrilling to tackle diffcult, delicious repertoire, and I enjoy composing my own melodies. Through music, I can share and celebrate my past. When I was asked to share my cultural talents at my high school, I looked for a song that my mother sang when I was young, but I could not fnd the sheet music. A week before tonight, I sat down by the old piano in the practice room at school. With only the old tune ringing faintly in my mind, my hands soon took a life of their own and experimented with chords, arpeggios, and trills. I superimposed these on the original melody and composed variations. My voice, too, frolicked with the piano as I sang the tune repeatedly. I was lost in another musical paradise. I felt like a child again, tucked under the covers, listening to my mother's song as I drifted away to dreams.

Now, dressed in an old Chinese dress that my mother had worn in her youth, I stepped onto the empty stage illuminated by pale blue light. I held the microphone up to my lips and smiled before starting. Then, I brought to life the beautiful ballad that had brightened my childhood in China. My mind overfowed with warm memories of that faraway city as I lulled the audience with my melody. When I caught my mother's face in the audience, I knew she nestled in the same air of nostalgia.

Music allows me to present my native culture and contribute to the diversity in my community. It has stimulated my mind and provided an outlet for my creativity. To me, nothing is more pleasurable than being imaginative. Carrying my childhood love of music through my teenage years has been a gratifying experience, and I look forward to continuing in my undergraduate years.www.cracksat.net

Overall, this is a strong essay that effectively conveys the writer's love for music and its impact on their life. The essay successfully creates a vivid picture of the writer's passion and showcases their personal growth through their musical journey. However, there are a few areas that can be improved to make the essay even more compelling.

Strengths:
1. Engaging introduction: The essay begins with a captivating opening sentence that immediately draws the reader in. The description of the moment before the writer's performance builds anticipation and sets the stage for the rest of the essay.
2. Clear structure: The essay has a clear structure, with a well-defined introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph focuses on a particular aspect of the writer's musical journey, creating a coherent narrative.
3. Descriptive language: The writer effectively uses descriptive language to paint a vivid image of their experiences. The details about singing with a makeshift curtain and composing their own melodies help the reader understand the writer's deep connection to music.
4. Personal reflection: The essay includes moments of personal reflection, such as when the writer talks about the emotions that music evokes in them and the satisfaction they derive from being imaginative. These reflections add depth and introspection to the essay.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of specificity: While the essay highlights the writer's love for music and their experiences with it, it lacks specific examples or anecdotes. Including specific instances where music had a profound impact on the writer's life would make the essay more memorable and compelling.
2. Limited exploration of cultural identity: The writer mentions their native culture in passing but does not delve deeper into how music connects them to their culture. Expanding on this aspect and discussing the role of music in celebrating their cultural heritage would add depth and uniqueness to the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Add specific examples: To make the essay more engaging, the writer should consider including specific examples of songs, performances, or musical challenges they have encountered. Personal anecdotes will make the essay more memorable and provide a deeper understanding of the writer's passion for music.
2. Connect music to cultural identity: The essay could be strengthened by exploring in more detail how music connects the writer to their Chinese heritage. Discussing specific songs that hold cultural significance or how the writer uses music to share their cultural talent would provide a unique perspective and further enhance the narrative.
3. Show growth and development: While the essay implies personal growth through music, the writer could provide more explicit examples of how their musical skills and understanding have evolved over time. This will portray the writer as someone who is dedicated and committed to their craft.

"I ran around nervously, yelling at my parents to wait downstairs; I did not want them to see anything that was going on. I rushed as fast as I could to make my bed, something most teenagers do not usually do. I made sure everything was in proper order as I called my parents up to my room. As I placed the last pillow on the bed, I acquired a sense of completion and achievement. I had done it; I designed and redecorated my bedroom. It was at this point when I, in my heart, became an interior designer.

This picture represents more than just a bedroom to me; it is my frst step on a path that I hope directs me to fulfllment. Designing my bedroom allowed me to explore the creative aspect of my life, and I was, and still am, able to appreciate the amount of creative talent I possess. It has become an intense passion in my life and I value this a great deal. This process illustrated the creative potential that I possess within myself, and I know that I can apply this promise in any aspect of my life.

One of the greatest features of this project I took on is that I was able to see the results of my actions immediately. It was a hands-on experience that I enjoyed to its fullest, and I was exultant with the outcome. Overall, this project was a great success in my eyes, and even in the eyes of my family and friends who are amazed at my capabilities with design. However, as the designer, I do get frustrated with infnitesimal faws. On the wall to the left of my bed there are two shelves and framed artwork that I created myself. In the process of the installation, I centered these shelves and artwork on the wall; however, the palm tree that I placed in the corner covers up one of the frames. I now know that it probably would have been better if I moved the shelves and artwork to the left of the wall. The importance of this is not the faw itself, but in the fact that I learned from what I had done and know how to improve myself the next time. Overall, I feel the room came out beautifully and it symbolizes my frst true triumph with design.

Though this project meant a great deal to me emblematically, I also just had fun with it. Utilizing my imagination, and fguring out how I was going to make things work within the room was simply enjoyable. not only was the design process pleasurable, but also the actual painting, nailing, and organizing itself was satisfying. I was also able to bond with my father through the project. He joined me in my most successful achievement of the room—the design and creation of the headboard. This venture and this picture epitomize my success. I consider my bedroom to be an elegant, contemporary work of art, and this picture embodies all the work I put into my design as well as the sense of achievement I received after its completion.www.cracksat.net

"I used to spend endless nights wide-eyed, anxiously dreading a high school life teeming with harsh peers and hollow hallways, immersed in a cold atmosphere eternally void of familiarity's warm embrace. I'll admit that this is not a hopeful vision; nevertheless, I certainly risked accepting this ugly reality when I supported my family's decision to uproot itself and move from new Jersey to Florida after my freshman year.

Somewhat fexible, my parents gave me a signifcant voice in the decision as I would be most profoundly affected. Yet, I had spent my entire life in the same cozy center-hall colonial in the same new Jersey suburb. I had known my friends since youth, when we had snowball fghts during the icy winter and ran through lawn sprinklers during the summer. Teachers knew my family and cordially greeted me in the halls. I could never move. In my mind, I was set!

Or was I? Instinct tugged at my heart, something was missing in my life because life is not about being ""set."" Lured by the concept of a fresh start, I yearned for the chance to write my own story. As the son of Indian immigrants, I had adventure in my blood; the time had come to venture beyond my comfort zone and stake a unique claim in Florida.The frst few months were trying; only birds joined me during lunch and I spend weekends alone writing introspective poetry. My ffteenth birthday centered on a family discussion about our affection for our new home while Hurricane Charley pounded the life out of Florida. I regretted moving. By fortuitous research, however, I learned more about innovative entrepreneurs who were shaping our world. I have not looked back since.

My self-inficted adversity fnally evoked personal growth. I constantly introduced myself to strangers and pursued my passions in different activities. By launching and supporting community organizations, I transformed into a proactive leader as I overcame diffculties in varied contexts. Continuously seeking challenges in the community and IB Program, I teamed up with other motivated citizens and students to thrive and contribute to my new home.

Today I am highly involved in my community with many friends and mentors. nobody knows me for my family or childhood, just for who I am today. The results of my own decisions and actions mean much more than what has been bestowed upon me. I would risk it all again because I know that I can only enjoy what I have earned. Breaking away from the risk-averse crowd that holds an exaggerated fear for what can be lost has been refreshing. I have gained trust in myself to defy odds because I never would have dreamt of the happiness and accomplishments that I have been honored to achieve in Florida.

College will certainly thrust a fercer Hurricane Charley at me, but I will stare it straight in the eye and exceed expectations, eventually leaving an enduring legacy for the world through my entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors.www.cracksat.net

"A thin shard of sunlight sliced through the vent of the windowless, cold, and cramped one bedroom basement apartment. The apartment stood three stories high with its weight suffocating the basement. I sat on the stained carpet, alone, playing with my one and only prized Hot Wheels car. My mother was working her ten-hour shift as a minimum wage waitress and my father was nowhere to be found. My father left our family when I turned three-years old. He also left the burden of his reckless gambling debt to my mother and left us to fend for ourselves. At the time, my mother barely spoke any English, yet she had to fnd work in order to support us. She became occupied with work, so I was frequently isolated at home. The house on Wellington Avenue in Daly City evolved to represent all the suppression my mother and I endured. As a child, wherever I could go to be away from the cell, I went.

A few days after my eleventh birthday, I trudged home on an afternoon to discover our house robbed again, this time of my mother's savings for the following month's rent and my new ""Stingray 5000"" water gun. I burst into tears and cried in my mother's fragile arms. It was that moment I vowed to do something about our situation. I was tired living in that horrid house, being deprived of my mother because of her demanding work schedule, and feeling like the whole world was constantly against us. Early in my childhood, I realized that our family was fnancially poor, because of that, I wanted to be rich in knowledge. Every day after school, I would take the transit to the Daly City Public Library where I could be away from the miserable house and focus on my studies. It was there that I would max out my library card to read Harry Potter novels and sit at the wide tables with my head in textbooks and magazines, searching for a better life. My mother knew the anger I had for the house, as a result, she would indirectly encourage me to channel out my negative feelings for the house into positive ones for learning by dropping by the library after work with apple juice for me. My appreciation for my mother is great because she still managed to set time aside from her work to attend to my needs. My objective was to gain all the knowledge I could, in hope of devising a plan to get us out of the Wellington Black Hole. At one point, I spent a whole Saturday looking for some sort of mathematical equation that would cure our blight. Enriching my knowledge was my na?ve way of trying to improve and control our bleak situation. Fortunately, my mother's relentless effort for work allowed us to move to a better part of Daly City.

When I fnally got my driver's license at the age of sixteen, after a vigorous curriculum of driver's education, driving lessons, and a driving test, the frst place I drove my mother's old Toyota Camry was to the house on Wellington Avenue. The freedom of driving allowed me to explore a place where I had been trapped in for so long. Crouched on the warm cement, I glanced pass the faded wooden walls and peered through the constricting vent to see the three year old that once sat on the cold foor. As I stood with the sun shining on my back, I acknowledged that my mother and I were given a situation that we did not choose, but we ultimately became the ones who changed the course of our lives. A photo of the Wellington house sits on my bedroom window edge, casting a small shadow when sun light beams in. It serves as a painful reminder of my background, and an inspiration to continue excelling in life, even when unfavorable conditions dominate.www.cracksat.net

"The hindu god, brahma, seeing the plight of a society tainted by envy and greed, presents a boy with a drum that he can only hear, not see. This instrument, which is supposed to bring patience and discipline to humanity, is the foundation of Indian classical music. The boy has yet to discover that musicians use this tool to speak, allowing their minds to transmit messages through the vibrant pulsations of their notes.

My guru told me this story when I began learning the tabla, a north Indian classical drum. Though he never revealed the ending, he offered one clue. ""It doesn't matter how fast your hands can beat the drum if your mind cannot keep up with them.""

A typical American teenager, I had always yearned for raw strength and speed on the tabla. I thought those were the qualities that made the perfect percussionist. During concerts, I saw musicians' fngers gliding across the head of the drum producing the extraordinary impression of force, immediacy of genius and intensity of passion that left audiences spellbound. I knew that to become the best at tabla, I needed to display my talent in a similar way. I wanted to play equally as fast and forcefully, even if it meant sacrifcing precision for power.

I asked my guru to train me to play like the maestros, but he said I lacked mental focus; I didn't listen to or enjoy my music. He believed the mind and body must be in sync in order to master the instrument. I never fully understood this concept until the imagination of one visually handicapped child attuned my mind to the beat of the drum.As a summer volunteer at the Braille Institute in Anaheim, I developed the musical talents of blind elementary school children through teaching the tabla. My friends and I bought instruments and music with the money that we made during a summer recycling program in our neighborhood. During our frst class, the children jumped into action, thumping erratically on their instruments. I chuckled at the sight of nine jubilant youngsters producing musical mayhem.

Chaandni was different. Shy and reserved, she felt the drum's smooth texture and stroked the soft middle portion of the drum head. I stood astonished as she performed her ritual. Tap. Listen. Smile. Tap. Listen. Smile. I could see her contemplating the emerging rhythm and resonance of each successive pulse. Watching a budding musician feel the delicate timbre of each drumbeat is a thrilling sensation.I learned more from observing than I did through years of erratic practice. Chaandni would eagerly listen to a musical piece, then strike incessantly until she produced a matching pitch. When she stumbled, she would sit patiently pinpointing her mistake. She didn't speak; her insight and emotion glowed through her music. For the frst time in my life I felt the depth of the drums. For the frst time, I truly comprehended and loved the instrument.

She was indeed a special soul. Her curiosity was insatiable; her regard for the drum was incomparable; her smile was inspiring. Her joyful progress inspired me to perform in London this summer with my guru. Driven by the spirit of a young girl who never let her disability impede her innate talent, I played gracefully in front of hundreds of spectators and cherished the inner triumph.

I am a living example of Brahma's story. The combination of grace and force on the tabla is my channel for communicating emotions. My tale ends with the appreciation that the mind is a beautiful vehicle for the drum.www.cracksat.net

"People say that inner beauty matters more than outer beauty. But when I looked into the mirror and saw my face covered with unsightly blemishes, it was hard to tell myself that and believe it. By the time I entered high school, my acne had gotten worse, and my self-esteem was at an all-time low. So in the summer of ninth grade, I embarked on an unexpectedly diffcult and emotionally trying quest for clear skin, an experience that culminated in one of my proudest achievements.

My typical daily diet consisted of sugary cereal for breakfast; salty turkey sandwiches, soda, and chips for lunch; a candy bar for snack; and rice and fried noodles for dinner. I never thought that my diet would be a cause of my acne, but the possibility frst came to me when I was reading a skincare article. Desperate for a cure, I searched ""clear skin diet"" on the Internet. The websites that turned up all echoed the same message: a balanced and healthy diet is crucial for beautiful skin. The recommended foods listed included large portions of fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and fsh; 8 glasses of water daily and only small amounts of high-sodium, high-fat, and high-sugar foods. I researched further and found out that the expensive chemical cleansers that I had been using were not the answer—gentle face washes and a coat of sunblock were inexpensive products that could reduce breakouts. I knew that changing my entire diet and skincare routine would require a tremendous amount of commitment and willpower. But determined to improve my skin and my self-confdence, I began to transform my lifestyle. I started by incorporating fruits and vegetables into my meals and replacing sugary cereal with whole grains, chips with carrots, and fried noodles with salmon. For a long, painful week, I stuck to this diet and restrained myself from any junk food. My skin condition changed gradually but substantially. By the end of the week, my skin was noticeably smoother, clearer, and brighter. Yet I found myself relapsing, unable to continue for long without indulging myself, unable to swallow the horribly plain salads and chewy carrots. Every time I stopped, the acne came back. It came to the point where I despised the acne and coveted the clear skin enough to force myself back on track. It became an excruciating pattern of cravings and self-restraint. I struggled with these two impulses until I became used to healthy eating, even enjoying it. now, two years later, my skin is better than ever and I have never gone back to eating the way I had before.

I have no awards or medals to show for my particular achievement. But no academic distinction in the world can match what I gained from my experience with changing my diet: healthier skin, self-confdence, and newfound mental strength. Above all, I realized that by improving my outer appearance, I had enriched my inner appearance.www.cracksat.net

"""All I know about leadership I learned from . . ."" What items could a person use to describe leadership qualities?

Inspired by the student council advisors at my high school.

Student council was a big part of my life in high school. I have participated in it since my frst year of high school. When I frst joined, I was quiet, na?ve, and unwilling to participate in many activities. I was scared to meet new people and afraid to apply myself. This all began to change. Half way through my frst year in student council, one of the advisors can up to me and asked why I did not participate that much. I did not have an answer for her and did not know how to respond. After this, I began to think of an answer. I became frustrated and decided to change. I started to show up at events and had a great time. I realized I loved this and wanted to start leading these activities. In my sophomore, junior, and now my senior year of high school, I asserted myself and took on a strong leadership role in student council. I did not fgure out the answer to why I was so reserved until this year with the help of this question.

When I looked up leadership in the dictionary, it said that it was the capacity to lead and the act or instance of leading. These are two very broad defnitions of leadership. Many people have different notions of what this word actually means. When I was challenged to use different items to describe what leadership actually is, I thought this was going to be a hard and obnoxious task. What could I learn from comparing leadership to a stuffed animal or a rubber chicken? But when I sat down to come up with a couple of answers, I realized that leadership could be compared to almost anything a person wants.

All I know about leadership I learned from a calculator. A calculator can add everything together to come up with the best answer. It can delete what is unnecessary and only include what is important. It can solve any type of problem. These are all important equalities a leader has to have. A leader has to be able to add all of the ideas together to make the best possible plan. Leaders have to know how to decipher the good and the bad out of an idea. They have to be versatile and know how to deal with different types of issues.

All I know about leadership I learned from a ball. A ball is able to bounce back up after it is dropped. It is round and has no creases. A ball can be thrown back and forth to different people. All of these qualities are also leadership qualities. A leader has to be ready for every situation that is thrown at him or her. He or she has to be able to bounce back from any setbacks and never dwell on the past. Leaders have to exhibit many qualities and never be closed-minded about a situation. A leader must be able to delegate when he or she cannot get the work done. They have to trust everyone they lead to be able to ""catch the ball"" and keep a project rolling.

This activity made me realize that being a leader is so much more than just having authority and having the ability to take control of a situation. A leader has to be trusting of all the people he or she leads and, leaders must be able to combine ideas into one encompassing idea. They cannot sit in the background and watch events happen; they have to jump in and be involved. They should not delegate all their responsibilities away.

Leadership is more than what the dictionary says it is.

I learned through all of this that I have many of these qualities.

I have the ability to solve problems, lead through adversity, and be versatile. From answering this question, I realized that I could lead effectively, even if my leadership style is different from other individuals. When I joined student council in my frst year of high school, I did not have these qualities because I was never put into a situation where I had to lead. I was too reserved to try. When I tried, I learned that I could succeed in this. I did not realize until I answered this question about leadership. I was never able to see that being a leader is not just about taking control of a group and telling everyone what to do. When I was a freshman, I thought leadership was this. I did not know that did not have to be forceful and strict. I stereotyped a leader then. Thisis where I went wrong. A leader is about being yourself and never letting anyone change you. I thought I had to change to be a good leaderOnly when I expanded my comfort zone did I realize this was not trueIt only took three years and a silly question/game to fgure this out.www.cracksat.net

"At my age, few people can genuinely claim that they have had a life-changing experience. After attending Leadership in the Business World (LBW) at the Wharton School last summer, I became one of those fortunate people to have experienced a life-changing academic program. Four weeks of meeting business executives, working with teammates through the night perfecting our professional business plan, experiencing the independence and responsibility that will come with college . . . none of this was advertised in the brochure for LBW, but all of this is what made it uniquely meaningful to me.

The business leadership program centered on one culminating activity: the prestigious LBW Business Plan Competition. As we prepared for this, we heard from Wharton faculty members and many corporate heavyweights including Brian roberts, CEO of Comcast Corporation. Meeting educators, executives and entrepreneurs broadened my knowledge of business, created a strategic network of connections and proved profoundly inspiring; nothing motivates me more than seeing hard work and sharp thinking reach fruition. I vividly remember when a managing director of a venture capital frm singled me out for a networking demonstration. Expecting me merely to pretend to hand him a fake business card, he was dumbfounded by impressed when he glanced back as he accepted an actual business card from my tutoring business. As my business card now rested in Mr. Kimmel's rolodex next to elegant cards from established businesspeople, a lesson was ingrained in my mind about acting uniquely in order to distinguish myself in a feld of equally qualifed and eager peers.

Despite the inherently competitive nature of LBW, I established enduring friendships with students from far-reaching places, such as Shanghai and Accra. We shared stories over meals in Houston Hall about life at home and engaged in heated discussions about business ethics. regardless of the origin of our passports, we became a family while learning about each other's cultures and future business aspirations. The lessons of compassion and hard work from the business plan competition also heightened my experience. Once when a fellow marketing offcer was struggling with determining channels of distribution for our product, I disregarded trying to seem individually superior, and we cooperatively tackled the problem. Putting the team before the individual was a concept that materialized itself during my experience. The bonds between all of the students and advisors spurred my entrepreneurial spirit as I experienced how friendship supports business.

I knew this experience had changed me forever when I triumphantly concluded our team's business presentation, confdently promoting our product and connecting with a crowd of peers and venture capitalists. During the evening following the presentations, my fellow teammates and I beamed with boundless relief and pride when the vcs announced our team, EnTECH LLC, as the frst place winners of the competition. Exploring and honing my business and entrepreneurial skills was intimidating initially, yet with creativity, hard work and an unparalleled group dynamic of cooperation, this experience cemented my passion for business and opened grand doors of opportunity.www.cracksat.net

"November 23, Two years ago: Thanksgiving. My mom and I celebrated the holiday as we had done for the last three years—by delivering turkey dinners to homebound senior citizens. After carrying the food to their kitchens, our brief visits with them were flled with laughter, hugs, and the sharing of family photo albums. In the midst of all the warmth and vitality, though, I couldn't help noticing the signs of loneliness and isolation: the windows with dust suggesting they hadn't been open in ages, the faded Christmas cards from 1995, and the tables with a single place setting. It was during these visits that I committed to fnd a way to better connect with the seniors in my community.

I discussed my desire with the mayor of Fremont in December two years ago. He agreed that a younger voice could prove to be benefcial and mentioned the Senior Citizen Commission for the City of Fremont (an advisory board to City Council that worked to directly address the needs of local seniors). I formally applied to the Commission and was unanimously appointed by City Council in February last year, becoming the youngest Commissioner in Fremont's history.

Although I was initially met with skepticism from my fellow Senior Citizen Commissioners, I was committed to sharing my vision of the benefts of intergenerational interactions. For the next two months, my after-school hours were devoted to calling nursing homes, negotiating with movie theater managers, and recruiting teen volunteers. The resulting event was the Senior Movie Outing, which paired teenagers with wheelchair-bound seniors for a fun afternoon at the movies.As a result of my hard work on the successful outing and the rave reviews from all who participated, my fellow Commissioners became more respectful of my contributions and open to my input. During the annual grant-reviewing period (when the Commission decides which non-proft organizations will receive City funding), I advocated to fund Lavender Seniors, an organization which supports gay and lesbian seniors. While it had not previously been funded by the City, I strongly believed it fell within the Commission's charter of ""serving the needs of all seniors."" After sharing my rationale for proposing to fund Lavender Seniors, I was proud that the Commissioners kept an open mind and the majority voted to grant the organization funding.

In the two years since my appointment, I have cherished the unique opportunities I have had to learn from people with different perspectives and backgrounds. My time on the Commission has taught me to be more confdent when expressing my ideas, and to be more open to hearing others' thoughts. I am proud to be a trusted voice for seniors in my community.www.cracksat.net

"I grew up in a four-room apartment in the middle of Beijing at the turn of the twentieth century. Common household features such as the existence of stairs within a house were thought of as decadent luxuries representative of the incredibly wealthy. My life was simple. At fve years old, it was differentiated by two things, the times I was with my mother and the times I was not.

My single mother was a chemist and professor at the University of Beijing. Even at a young age, she distinguished herself from her peers with her remarkable ambition and intense passion for learning. From growing up in the frigid winds of northern Mongolia, to becoming one of three students to earn a full scholarship to China's most competitive university, to working as a government-sponsored chemist in goslar, germany, my mother accomplished more before I was born than most people achieved in a lifetime.

Unfortunately, I would not learn of the fabulous successes and arduous trials of my mother until much, much later. All I could understand or not understand at fve years old was why my mother was rarely home, why I did not see her for three months during the summer when I lived with my grandparents, and why I was forced to go to a daycare owned by a tyrannical monster who would tell ghost stories to make me cry. Even now, much of my knowledge about my mother's early life is something I am still piecing together. As was the case then, my full understanding of her brilliant yet ill-tempered persona is continually hindered by the simple troubles of life. Although now, they are the issues of an eighteen-year old teenager rather than those of a fve-year old child.

I remember nights we would spend together when she was busy with her research and classes; I would sit in a desk next to her, drawing pictures and imagine that I was her personal assistant. I also remember times when I had to stay home alone because she had a lecture to give or errands to run; I would lean against the window sill staring down into the bleak, concrete streets waiting and watching for the return of a petite form in a bright red jacket. Yet despite the forlorn days and the lonely nights, I feel neither regret nor resentment towards those early years or my mother. On the contrary, I am incredibly proud and grateful for all the diffculties she endured in order to raise me properly. Had it not been for my childhood experiences, I would not have matured at such an early age or developed such a strong sense of independence.

We moved to America in the spring of 1997. The transition of cultures was daunting yet it failed to dishearten my mother. Like every other experience in her life, she treated the move as an opportunity. However, even my mother was not immune to the overwhelming cultural shock, and despite her perseverance and accomplishments, she continually struggled with the language barrier and the difference in societal values.

While my mother was forced to labor against such changes, my young age enabled me to adapt quickly to the new environment. Unfortunately, my ""Americanization"" has caused a great deal of mystifcation and incomprehension in my mother. not only do our manners of speaking differ, but we no longer view traditional beliefs the same way. Her lack of encouragement for my participation in athletics and her excessive emphasis on my grades have been both frustrating and upsetting. From my gregarious nature and social outings to my obdurate refusals to comply with her every long-established demand, she has been forced to accept the evolution of her daughter from that of Chinese doll to American teenager.nevertheless, despite our various differences and my acute assimilation into another culture, I have never lost sight of what mattered most to me, nor forgotten the roots of my heritage and rigorous upbringing. My mother's persistence and endurance are qualities which I have proudly assumed and carried with me in every activity of my life. From facing the ignorant racisms of elementary classmates to the malicious jealousies of middle school peers, I have never doubted or second guessed the work ethic and moral code that she instilled in me. Her resourcefulness has also been highly infuential and taught me of the importance of seeking opportunities. Whether it was working along side Philadelphia Inquirer journalists or researching marketing strategies for a startup company, I have learned and developed with each success and letdown encountered throughout my middle and high school years.

The diffculties of my mother and the diffculties that I faced in two countries on two continents continue to defne and shape my personality and character. As mother and daughter continue along the journey of life, I hope that she can come to accept and embrace the daughter whom she has so diligently raised while I hope to slowly unravel the full mystery that is my mother and, one day, fnally comprehend and appreciate the entirety of her effect on my life.www.cracksat.net

"After spending a week with John nash, I may have stumbled upon a central purpose of my life. Well, not nobel Laureate John nash himself, but whenever I describe Fred, their characteristics seem quite parallel. Fred is unique, possessing an indomitable spirit to fulfll his dreams without fear of failure. not only is he the most brilliant young man I have ever met, he exhibits a genuinely compassionate heart. Sadly, many people may never recognize Fred as the beautiful individual that he is, or what he has to offer. While our society may call him ""challenged,"" I have come to recognize him as an unexpected role model. For Fred, you see, is autistic. He does not interact well with people, and is often unable to express his thoughts clearly or articulately. He doesn't understand why people laugh at him. Yet even so, Fred is blessed with an acute sense of purpose and caring that is unmatched by most—including perhaps even the most altruistic among us.

Several years ago I traveled with a small group of Fairfax County high school students to Portland, Oregon to compete as a Finalist in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I was excited at what was certain to be an experience of a lifetime—having no clue that the most valuable lesson would come not from the Science Fair itself, but from Fred. Because of my prior experiences in working with special needs children, the school administrators asked me to room with Fred during the trip. I distinctly recall my initial anxiety and reluctance about the prospect of taking care of another individual during the stressful, high-pressure atmosphere of the competition. In retrospect, though, this was the beginning of an incredible journey for both of us—but especially for me.

Fred's passion—actually more of an obsession—is theoretical mathematics. He eats, breathes, talks, and probably sleeps mathematics, to the point where he annoys others by his constant chatter about it. His idea of fun is solving differential equations on a napkin in a fancy restaurant, oblivious to others wanting to socialize or relax. That Fred is brilliant is unquestioned, a fact that was clearly evidenced in his science project where he solved a math problem previously believed by experts to be insolvable. Yet in his own mind Fred frmly believed his entire raison d'etre in life was the pursuit of math—and that he was destined to use his incredible mathematical ability to help make the world better.

However, Fred's disabilities were only a fraction of the challenges that faced him. growing up in a dysfunctional home, he suffered from a lack of love and patient understanding. Still, Fred's life revolved around his relationships and mathematics. Although he has few close friends, people are indescribably important to him, and he always treated them with sensitivity and compassion. Unfortunately, some people—including but not limited to his peers (who can sometimes be quite cruel)—are unable to set aside their prejudices long enough to see his uniqueness as the incredible gift that it is. His enthusiasm and his indomitable spirit in the face of adversity taught me valuable lessons—lessons I will carry with me for the rest of my life. He taught me to live for what you truly cherish, to be passionate about your dreams, and to always smile in both the service of others and adversity. He has shown me the truest meaning of love for others, and the ability to understand and always live for what is important. A trip that started with me ""taking care of him"" turned into a trip of substantial personal discovery.

Children with special needs have powerful talents, and if we could only open our hearts to hear their voices, we would learn what it means to live without conventional boundaries. I have lived a week with a genius, not only of the mind, but more importantly, of the heart—and my life has been permanently changed because of Fred.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 60/100

Strengths:
- The essay effectively conveys the writer's admiration for Fred and their personal connection.
- The introduction paragraph grabs attention by mentioning John Nash and sets up the theme of the essay.
- The writer provides specific examples and anecdotes to support their statements about Fred's character and abilities.
- The conclusion effectively ties the essay back to the writer's personal growth and the importance of understanding and accepting individuals with special needs.

Areas of Concern and Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Lack of structure: The essay lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow the writer's main points. It would benefit from a more organized and logical flow of ideas. Consider dividing the essay into distinct sections or paragraphs, each focused on a specific aspect of Fred's character or the writer's experience.
2. Lack of focus: While the essay is centered around Fred, it jumps between different aspects of his life and personality without a clear focus. The writer should identify one or two specific qualities or experiences of Fred to highlight, rather than trying to cover too much ground. This will allow for a deeper exploration of those qualities and a more coherent and impactful essay.
3. Vague language: The essay frequently uses vague and general statements without providing concrete evidence or examples. For example, the writer mentions that Fred is the ""most brilliant young man"" they have ever met and that his ""enemies"" are unable to recognize his uniqueness. These statements need to be supported with specific examples or anecdotes to give them more credibility.
4. Lack of self-reflection: While the essay briefly touches on the writer's personal growth and the lessons they learned from Fred, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of the writer's own experiences and emotions. This will help the admissions team understand the impact that Fred had on the writer and why his influence is significant.
5. Language and grammar: The essay contains several grammar and punctuation errors that can be distracting. It is important to proofread the essay and ensure that it is free of grammatical mistakes.

In conclusion, while the essay has potential, it would benefit from a clearer structure, a focused and specific approach to Fred's character, and more detailed supporting evidence and self-reflection. The writer should also pay attention to language and grammar to ensure a polished final draft. With these improvements, the essay has the potential to be a powerful and memorable addition to the student's college application."
"Crime Scene Report

Crime: Missing Person

Location: Duke University, 2138 Campus Drive, Box 90586, Durham, north Carolina 27708-0586

Time: October 2, 2008, 11:00 A.M.

Investigated by: Admissions Offcers of Duke University

case description:

On the morning of October 2, 2008, at precisely 7:00 A.M., a Miss Lauren Sanders began to worry. Her future-self entered the gates of a prestigious university in the fall of 2009 and had not returned home. Miss Sanders fled a missing person's report, hoping someone could help her to locate her future-self in a world of possibilities.

The case began with a grueling interrogation of Miss Lauren Sanders, the person who knew most about her future-self. However, the questioning session yielded little information. Miss Sanders could not fully describe herself in the future. Pressured, she stated that ""she has the ambition to fulfll all of her goals, is both stubborn and industrious, and wants to experience University life."" Miss Sanders lacked a photograph of her future-self, but remarked that ""she has brown hair, likes to describe herself as vertically-challenged, and is usually smiling.""

NOTE: While unable to describe her future-self, Miss Sanders believed that examination of past experiences could possibly assist the admissions offcers in the case. According to Miss Sanders, her future-self has ""volunteered in her community and traveled on a global scale.""

Physical evidence collected during a thorough search of Miss Sander's bedroom included a Dell laptop, a collection of Jane Austin novels, worn textbooks, and an I-pod. Fingerprinting analysis and DnA processing determined that these items belong to both Miss Sanders and her future-self, and that they use these items frequently. Despite biological traces of the future-self found within the home, laboratory analysis concluded that Miss Sanders' future-self does not reside within her hometown.

With information gathered from the physical search of Miss Sanders' home and Miss Sanders' interrogation, a database search was conducted to determine possible universities in which Miss Sanders' future-self resided. Within minutes, Duke University appeared as a match.With this lead, authorities conducted numerous searches at Duke University in Durham, north Carolina, probing the dorms, library, and classrooms. All searches yielded nothing, yet the possibility of fnding Miss Sanders' future-self remains strong. Professors and students alike, when questioned about Miss Sanders' future-self, strongly believe that many individuals like her come to the University to fnd their potential paths.

Further examination will be needed to complete this investigation, including a thorough inspection of Miss Sanders' resume and letters of recommendation. Hopefully, the leads that we have will direct us to the whereabouts of her future-self.

Note: According to Miss Sanders, the future-self plans to travel on a foreign-exchange student program and hopes to conduct research in one of the many labs available to undergraduates. At present, these areas have not been searched by professionals.

On the morning of October 2, 2009, at precisely 7:04 A.M., the admissions offcers found Miss Lauren Sanders' future-self at Duke University. She had hidden in the incoming student body.www.cracksat.net

Overall Score: 60/100

Strengths:
- The essay has a creative and engaging concept, using the format of a crime scene report to describe the search for the missing future-self of the applicant.
- The use of specific details, such as the location and time of the incident, adds a sense of authenticity to the narrative.
- The opening sentence grabs the reader's attention and sets the stage for the essay's unique approach.

Weaknesses:
- The essay lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to follow the progression of the investigation. It jumps back and forth between different aspects of the search without a cohesive narrative.
- The language and tone of the essay do not match the formal style expected in a college application essay. The use of phrases like ""a grueling interrogation"" and ""pressured"" detracts from the professionalism of the piece.
- There is a lack of personal connection and reflection. The essay focuses more on the investigation process and the description of the applicant's future-self, rather than providing insight into the applicant's own aspirations and goals.
- The essay uses too much direct dialogue without proper attribution or formatting, which makes it confusing to read.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the structure of the essay: Create clear sections or paragraphs for each step of the investigation, such as the initial report, the questioning session, the physical evidence, the search at Duke University, etc. This will help the reader follow the storyline more easily.

2. Refine the language and tone: Maintain a professional and formal tone throughout the essay. Avoid using phrases that sound too dramatic or informal. This will enhance the credibility of the essay and align it with the expectations of admissions officers.

3. Provide more personal reflection: Instead of solely focusing on the search for the future-self, include the applicant's own aspirations and goals. Show how their experiences, interests, and achievements relate to their desire to attend Duke University.

4. Properly attribute and format dialogue: Use quotation marks and proper attributions to clearly indicate when someone is speaking. This will make the essay easier to read and follow.

5. Consider revising the conclusion: The ending feels abrupt and doesn't fully tie back to the initial concept. Tie it to the applicant's own journey and make a final reflection on the importance of finding the future-self at Duke University.

Remember, the personal statement should primarily focus on the applicant and their unique qualities, experiences, and aspirations. Use the crime scene concept as a creative framework, but ensure that the essay remains centered on the applicant and their personal narrative."
"EVERY FAMILY HAS THEIR STORY, ALL with aspects that brings them together or drive them apart. I come from a Mexican family, where family is the only thing we know. We share each other's pain and misery and we rejoice for our miracles. We learn and grow through each other. Even through the darkest days we survive as one. I witnessed those dark days, but I also saw the bright and through it all I evolved into who I am today.

I encountered one of my biggest obstructions when I was a child. I was born into a family that had immigrated to America from Mexico. Although my parents had been in the country for quite some time, they never adapted to the American lifestyle. All I knew was Spanish and my frst year of school would soon come. I would sit at the end of my driveway and listen to the variety of sounds that slowly crept into my ear, triggered a reaction and sent confusion running through my mind. Day after day, I would sit there trying to decode this puzzle word by word and the day came when I'd be shipped off to school where I was expected to know English. Kindergarten was one of the hardest years in my life. I struggled tremendously. I was the last one to know my address, I was the last one to know my phone number, and I was the one who almost failed his frst year of school. If it wasn't for my father not allowing the school to hold me back, I could have become a completely different person. I struggled throughout my years in elementary school. I went to resource and received help with my schoolwork until fourth grade. I was given a big push forward and since then I have come to realize that I may not be the only one in need. Others will need help and I will be there with a helping hand.

Through the years, my family has undergone a variety of obstacles. I saw my brother completely stumble and fall when he impregnated his girlfriend at the age of sixteen. At the blink of an eye he became a father to be and a husband. Everything came to a halt and he needed to support another person. He worked during the night and fnished high school during the day. He struggled even while living at home. As if one example in my house wasn't enough, my sister was expecting a child during her senior year. I remember the day when she told my parents, I was in the room next door crying in pain because she fell into the same trap my brother did. That was the end for her. She graduated from high school and began to work. now she has two daughters and is trying to make a living. It is hard to see the people you love make mistakes. It is so hard, that it brings tears to my eyes, to know that you wish you could say everything will be ok. They are stuck in a rut and I am putting my best foot forward to give myself the future they don't have.

When my mother was a child she had suffered a great amount. She had become deaf in her teenage years. She lost complete ability to hear in her right ear and partially in the left and to add to all the confusion she was bound by a language. She was living in America with 4 of 5 senses and a tongue that many could not speak. Many would see this as a huge dent in her life, but she managed to start a family. I could not be any more proud of her and thankful for what she has given me. Her ""disability"" placed a tremendous amount of pressure on my shoulders. She was not able to go to the deli or to place phone calls when she needed to. All of a sudden, all of this had become my responsibility. My father was too busy breaking his back in order to support our family. My mother's personal translator, doesn't sound too shabby? Standing in the middle of the store, making hand jesters, mouthing out words, or even yelling, does attract attention. In those moments I would feel a surge of heat rush from head to toe, goose bumps in every possible crevice of my body, and to top it all off I'd be seven shades darker than a ripe tomato. Shame and embarrassment, how could I feel this way? All this had become routine and the pain and embarrassment fnally started to subside, a whole new feeling started to emerge, pride. My mother made me strong. She allowed me to become the man I am today. And after all the pain there are still countless nights that I lie in bed, crying due to the burden that was placed on her and the tremendous lesson I learned. Every sound, every beat, every photon, every little everything has been absorbed into me one way or another, yet these experiences, although insignifcant to others, mean to world to me. All these events run through my veins and pump through my heart. I am the passion that is rarely seen. I am the walking story of struggle.www.cracksat.net

Overall, this essay does a decent job of conveying the author's personal experiences and the impact they have had on their growth and determination. The essay presents a clear narrative about the challenges faced by the author's family and their commitment to overcoming them. However, there are several areas where the essay could be strengthened and improved.

Strengths:
- The essay effectively conveys the importance of family and the author's strong bond with their Mexican heritage. The author's pride and sense of responsibility shine through.
- The narrative structure is relatively clear, with each paragraph discussing a different obstacle faced by the author's family.
- The author's personal growth and commitment to helping others is well conveyed. Their determination to create a different future for themselves is inspiring.

Areas of concern:
- The essay lacks specific examples and anecdotes that would give it more depth and make it more engaging. While the essay does talk about the challenges faced by the author's family, it would benefit from specific incidents or stories that demonstrate these challenges and the author's personal growth more vividly.
- The language and writing style could be improved. There are instances of awkward phrasing, incorrect grammar, and run-on sentences that make the essay less impactful. It would be beneficial for the author to revise and polish their writing to create a stronger overall impression.
- The essay could provide more reflection and analysis. While the author briefly mentions feelings of shame, embarrassment, and pride, they could go into more detail about how these experiences shaped their character and perspective on life. Adding more introspection and self-awareness would deepen the impact of the essay.

Suggestions for improvement:
1. Add specific examples and anecdotes: Rather than just stating the challenges their family faced, the author should give specific incidents or stories that illustrate these challenges. This would lend more credibility and emotional weight to the essay.
2. Revise and polish the writing: The author should go through the essay and correct any errors in grammar, sentence structure, and style. They should also consider using more descriptive language and varied sentence structures to make the essay more engaging.
3. Reflect and analyze further: The author should expand on their feelings of shame, embarrassment, and pride. How did these emotions shape them? How do they view their family's challenges and their own role in overcoming them? Adding more introspection and personal reflection would enhance the essay's impact.

Overall, this personal statement has potential but would benefit from stronger storytelling, improved writing, and deeper reflection. With some revisions and additions, the essay could become a compelling narrative that leaves a lasting impression on admissions officers. I rate this essay a 65/100."
"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH Tae Kwon Do, music, art, and friends. However, as a horse in Chinese astrology, I also need to explore different pursuits, and step outside of my comfort zone. This summer, I ventured beyond the pasture of my comfort zone, and participated onstage in the high school summer musical for the frst time.The biggest challenge of taking this leap was overcoming my own mental barrier—the sign that read, Jean, you have never had a dance lesson; you have no idea how to sing or act. Out of fear that I would feel uncomfortable, I believed that playing violin in the pit orchestra was my calling. However, after three years of pit orchestra experience, I longed to shine in that coveted spotlight. I did not tell my friends about how I wondered what it would feel like to act onstage in front of eight hundred people. When I saw that the title of the musical for this past summer was Anything goes, I knew that no one would think worse of me for following my aspirations. Confdent that my friends would encourage me, I let go of my cautious Chinese approach to life, and let the free-spirited horse within me escape.

Despite my decision to participate in the musical, I was terrifed. I wondered whether I would meet any friends and if I would be able to learn to sing and dance well. My fears were intensifed because I missed the frst week of rehearsals while at a leadership conference in new York City. When I attended my frst rehearsal, arriving directly from new York City, my fortitude kept me steady. With confdence and new York City memories in my heart, I joined the rest of the cast and reveled in the excitement. I followed my new friends with a passion for an art form that I hardly knew, but willingly embraced.

From that moment on, I was a horse freely cantering around an open meadow. I had discovered a new point of view, and the grass was greener than it had ever seemed. Some days, I came home with new dance steps to show my parents. On other days, I drew the designs of my costumes when my descriptions at the dinner table would not suffce. The make-up artist tried three times to fnd the right blush, while the hair team created a different style for me each night. Having to think up a new hairstyle each time was parallel to my shifting opinion of my life and self. Although participating in the musical was initially petrifying, I discovered that taking such a risk was the optimal way to grow and change.

Now, I will not shy away from being in a musical cast because my comfort zone is expanding. Soon it will encompass the grand scope of my interests: from singing and dancing to throwing a sales pitch in front of judges; from learning how to execute precision front-fips to building my favorite piano repertoire; from designing a webpage to arranging chamber music, or developing optics technologies. Such passions will continue to defne who I am and what I hope to achieve. My character is being shaped and reshaped by my learning experiences because I am an impressionable human being. As I continue to explore, I know that my interests will solidify into a cohesive whole. Until then, I seek to enrich myself with new opportunities and never look back.www.cracksat.net

"""HERITAGE"" IS THE FIRST WORD IN my family dictionary, a noun and adverb, for who we are and how we live. My parents taught me that my heritage defnes my identity. Through honorifc speech towards my elders and adherence to traditional values, I accepted Korean customs as part of the duality that defnes my life in America.

Yet, a turbulent disunity stormed under that surface of peaceful coexistence. Though I outwardly represented the model Korean-American son, I loathed ftting this stereotypical mold. My shell was so well-constructed, however, that others mistook me for a successful immigrant. I felt as if I were ripped from the very fabric of my American birthplace, and plunged into a vacuum between my ancestral home and the world I lived in. I felt that my heritage was a short anchor against the relentlessly rising tide: I had to break free—or go under.

While struggling with this chain, however, I came to appreciate what my heritage offered. As a martial arts instructor, I supported students in building discipline and character. As a bilingual tutor, I helped immigrant children adapt to life in America. Soon, I realized that my heritage was an instrument for harmonizing personal development with service to others.

When I was selected to serve in the HOBY World Leadership Congress, my family's fnancial circumstances did not cover the $1,350 required fee. By infusing my American entrepreneurial energy with Asian medicine, I covered the cost by selling herbal products at my martial arts studio. Though the novelty of my venture brought me to the verge of bankruptcy, I persisted. By researching products, competitors and clientele, I streamlined my inventory to best serve my customers.

Eventually, I created a business aimed at offering others a healthy lifestyle. Sweaty students gulped green tea and chocolate-favored snacks, dropping dollars for the cause that lay within my cardboard cashbox. Supported by outside donations, I became greater L.A.'s ambassador in Washington D.C. Infused with new inspiration, I returned with a project grant to spread the martial arts lifestyle of discipline, confdence, and respect.

As my heritage anchored itself to the bedrock of my battles, I integrated Korean tradition with my American identity. Fusing service with civic duty, I entered the L.A. County Sheriff's Explorer Academy. Through the grueling training, I learned to work as part of a team. Appointed as Drill Instructor a year later, I took command of training the older recruits. Through a relationship of mutual respect, I prepared my platoon to dutifully serve the community. Leading this racially mixed group, I empathized beyond the duality of my own identity. I soon discovered that my heritage must transcend my personal struggles to truly embrace diversity.

Heritage is not a mere ethnic label—it is the honor and humanity that I am inspired to uphold. Today, I am grateful to my parents for endowing me with a spirit of dedication and determination. They bestowed a philosophy that speaks through my actions. This inheritance forms the base of my integrity as an individual, and defnes my dedication to strengthening the society that I live in.www.cracksat.net

"THE TITLE OF THIS PICTURE IS ""Abuelo"" which means grandfather in Spanish. At frst glance, it seems just a waste of a snapshot. Perhaps just another struggling photographer trying to pay the rent or who simply had one more shot left in a roll of flm and took a random picture. It is an 8"" by 11"" color photograph of a man's neck, more specifcally the back of his neck. It is quite wrinkled and brown and white hair has invaded the scalp. At frst I questioned why the photographer did not simply take a picture of his grandfather's face. A face would allow viewers to see what the grandfather looks like and tell some kind of story, certainly more than what the back of his neck could possibly tell.What I came to realize is that this is no random shot. What this picture wants is for me to imagine and to create a story. It does not necessarily wish to be framed but the picture does not want to be overlooked or neglected. It wants to be given a chance to prove itself as equally worthy as any other photograph. I do not need the face of the Abuelo to imagine the story of his life or personality. The back of his neck is just as important as his face.

After spending some time with this Abuelo I learned that the back of his neck is not just brown, it is tanned. not just a natural tan, that some people are born with, but a particular shade of tan that can only be attained after continuous exposure to the sun. Perhaps this man does a lot of work outside. The distinguished wrinkles are more than just lines. In between them there seems to be some kind of dust. I recognize this dust because it is the kind of dust my father gets when he is working with joint compound.

After examining a little more closely I noticed the multiple scars on his scalp which prevent his hair from growing. The tiny hole in his earlobe reminds me that he was young once and had, like many young teenage boys, pierced his ear. Around his neck I can see a glimpse of a brown necklace. This necklace is very familiar to me because I own one. It is a very thin string with a small rectangular cloth at both ends. Many Catholics believe that it is something sacred.

In this case this picture is not measured by the thousands of words it is worth, but it is measured by what I took from it. It should not be criticized by what it does not have but should be valued for what it does have. I have found something in common with this photograph. All along what this picture wanted from me was to fnd something familiar. That familiarity sets this particular picture apart from all other photographs I have encountered and what has kept it vividly visible after having come across it years ago. This is exactly what this photograph longed for: to be found familiar and remembered.www.cracksat.net

"MY FAMILY HAS TAKEN LIVING IN the big city as a reason for why we should never give up. Here in Los Angeles there are countless individuals and families along all points on the immigration spectrum from recent arrivals to recent citizenship. residing in this great city has provided me with diversity, opportunity, acceptance, and an abundance of role models to follow through all troubles- big and small.

I always thought that I had it the worst out of all my family members because I was never allowed to get anything lower than what my brother or a cousin had gotten in a class. My parents fgured if they could do it, so could I, and if not on my own then with a little of their help. It was not until recently that I realized the truth in this. In my short life I have seen my father go from speaking no English, to excelling in it. I have heard countless stories about migrant farmers such as Cesar Chavez and my grandfather who had nearly nothing, yet persisted and succeeded.

growing up hearing these stories of great injustices and misfortunes has truly infuenced my long term goals. I am going to go far because there is no excuse for not doing my best, given all I have been blessed with. When I had trouble speaking Spanish and felt like abandoningmy native tongue I remembered my mother and how when she camto the United States she was forced to wash her mouth out with soapand endure beatings with a ruler by the nuns at her school for speaking it. When I couldn't fgure out tangents, sines, and cosines I thoughabout my father and how it took him nearly a year to learn long division because he was forced to teach it to himself after dropping out andstarting to work in the 4th grade. And when I wanted to quit swimmingbecause I was tired I remembered my grandfather and how no matter how his muscles ached if he stopped digging, or picking fruit, oplowing he risked not having enough food to feed his family. Pursuingtechnical felds such as math and engineering frst seemed like work fomen to me, but the times have changed. All these people, just from myfamily have been strong role models for me.

I feel that being labeled ""underprivileged"" does not mean that I amlimited in what I can do. There is no reason for me to fail or give upand like my parents and grandparents have done, I've been able to pulthrough a great deal. My environment has made me determined, hardworking, and high aiming. I would not like it any other way. This ihow my Hispanic heritage, family upbringing, and role models havinfuenced my academic and personal long term goals.www.cracksat.net

"EVERY YEAR, MY CHRISTMAS WISH LIST would read, ""Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is a baby brother."" At age nine, I knew Santa had to be real because, one day, my mom announced that she was pregnant. After ten years of being an only child, I could not have anticipated how much my life would change because of a little brother. I received the honor of naming him, and I chose Jason. In retrospect, I should have named my brother ""Ivan the Terrible.""

Jason followed me everywhere like an irritating shadow. My grievances to my mom were countless, especially after Jason drew all over my bedroom walls and murdered my pet fsh, goldie. My mom's typical response was, ""Well, isn't this what you've always wished for?""Jason's mischief reached a new height one morning when I became the victim of a fve year old with scissors. I stared into the bathroom mirror and dunked my head under cold water to make sure I was not dreaming. What I saw enraged me! In the middle of the night, Michael had cut off fve inches of my long, black hair from one side of my head. I stood in horror, and stormed to the kitchen where I found the rest of my family calmly eating breakfast. I fashed a menacing stare at my brother, who snickered across the table. ""You're going to pay for this!"" I screamed. Furious beyond words, I could not even begin to describe my rage. Instead, I ran back to the bathroom and huddled on the foor.

""What am I going to do?"" I was irate and panicked at the same time. As a freshman in high school, I was very sensitive about my appearance. I had been hesitant to cut my hair past the ""tips to take away the split-ends"" trim, because my hair had been the same length for seven years. I agonized over the situation and concocted my swift counter-attack. Instead of chopping off his hair, I found inspiration to appease my anger in the pages of Teen magazine and considered trendy hairstyles. My brother was stunned because I did not retaliate. victory was mine.Because of experiences such as this, I have learned to adapt, to keep my focus, and to solve problems with little or no resources. I approach tough situations with objectivity and determination. Like many other experiences with my brother and at school, I have dealt with diffcult situations and turned them into positive opportunities for change. I am fexible with the circumstances given to me, and I strive for the best outcome. Despite the craziness Santa's gift brings, Jason's continuous surprises provide laughter to my life. As for my hair, I did cut off the fve inches from the other side, and I actually cherished the new look better. Thanks, Santa.www.cracksat.net

"EVERY SUNDAY MORNING, THE LOCAL STARBUCKS plays host to what my mom likes to call ""mother-son bonding time."" This Sunday is no different. My mom and I sit down with our regular Chai Latte and Caramel Frappuchino, and absorb the aroma of the coffee beans and the gentle rays of the winter sun.

""So Alex, what are we going to do for dad's 50th birthday?"" When my mom asks a question about upcoming plans, she doesn't expect an answer; she already has something in mind. Many years ago, my mom started a family tradition of making gifts personal: poems, songs, skits. At frst I didn't understand why we were wasting so much time when we could just buy a gift card from the local mall. But my outlook changed when I turned twelve. For my birthday, my parents gave me a poster, a product of their many hours on Photoshop. With long hair, sideburns, and a slim suit, I had become the ffth member of the Beatles crossing Abbey road. Every morning when I wake up, this poster opposite my bed is the frst thing I see, and I start off the day with a smile. Since then, I have needed little persuasion to start working on the next gift project. Actually, I even look forward to these times, when my parents fnd their inner children, and the trivial worries of life simply whisk away. My dad, both fguratively and literally, ditches his offce suit and proper manners, and dons a red woman's wig and high heels to practice a scene. My mom stops scolding my sister and me, and joins us in our ruckus, doing the jitterbug and blowing on a harmonica. These are the moments in my family when there are no children or adults, just four people who give in to their creative urges.

""How about throwing Dad a party, and making him a movie?"" my mom asks as I use my straw to fsh for any remaining coffee at the bottom of the cup. ""Just think of a movie you like and we'll parody it."" A big fan of ""the-life-is-like-a-box-of-chocolates"" theory, I suggest my favorite movie, Forrest gump. She smiles. ""OK, but only if you play Forrest.""

When we come home, my mom takes down a box, heavy with the dust of age, scribbled with messy russian lettering. I peer over her shoulder as she empties onto the living room foor the contents: my dad's life story in black and white. Within minutes, I am completely immersed in the photographs I have never seen before. As I gape at a picture of a bearded teenager laughing with his friends, I do a double take. Is this the same clean-shaven man who helped me to prove the theorem that all right angles are congruent and always tells me to tuck in my shirt? I shake my head in disbelief as I thumb through some pictures of my dad and his friends with guitars in the forest singing songs around a camp fre. My mom explains that the Soviet government didn't approve of these songs, so the woods became their only refuge. I am now starting to understand why my dad, limited in what he could sing or say as a youth, pushes my sister and me to ask probing questions, survey news from all sides of the political spectrum, and watch controversial movies. Looking down at one of the pictures of my dad in the forest, it just hits me: the movie should be called ""Forest guy.""

With each picture comes its own story, and collectively, they create a collage of my dad's past that I had never known. But even more surprises await me as I watch documentaries about russian leaders in the 20th century. To truly parody Forrest gump, some ""great"" Communist leaders must be part of Forest guy's life, just as Kennedy and nixon were part of Forrest gump's. Coming up with bizarre ideas of how my dad met the Communist leaders is the most entertaining part of our moviemaking. My stomach throbs with laughter as I conceive the impossible notion of my dad bullying gorbachev into destroying the Berlin Wall.

Along with russian history, I also discover part of my family's: while discussing the horrors of Stalin's reign with my mom, I am shocked to hear that my father was born in exile, and one of his uncles died in Stalin's concentration camp for joking about Communists. It's hard to believe that someone can be killed for cracking a joke, when cracking a safe will only get you a few years in jail. Luckily, when I am joking about Lenin and Stalin in my flm, my only worry is crowd response.It is the day of the party, and as I look around at the apprehensive crowd, my instincts yell, ""run, Alex! run!"" Soon, the lights dim, and my anxiety grows. I am watching the viewers as intensely as they are watching the screen. As each joke is met with uproarious laughter and table slapping, my breaths become calmer and my fingers stop shaking. Twenty-fve minutes later, I hear the long awaited ovation. I gaze from table to table at the sea of smiles, but one face catches my attention. It is my dad's, showing complete disbelief that something so grandiose could be done about him and for him. All these weeks I had been so focused on the guests' reactions that I never thought about my dad's. Although he is trying hard to contain himself, I see a tear sneak from the side of his eye. It is the frst time I have seen my dad cry.Yes, life is a box of chocolates. Some are delicious, some too bitter for your taste. But the best are like the one I picked that day; they seem like any other chocolate, but when you bite into them, they surprise you with an unexpected favor.www.cracksat.net

"THE GIANT BROWN BEAR WAS CREEPING quietly behind the blissfully pink duck ready to wring his bare paws around her neck and throw her into a pot of boiling stew.

We turned the page.

While I chuckled at the impracticality of a bear boiling water to eat a duck, especially a pink duck, I lifted my head to fnd Matthew tiptoeing about the room exhibiting the meanest, most ferocious look his cute face could conjure. All the while, little Monica sat huddled next to my arm honestly afraid to turn the page and fnd her favorite pink creature in a bear's ""tummy.""

It was one of those moments of my hours spent reading with children at the library when it dawned just how much, as a ""grown up,"" I was missing.

I remembered the Thursday when victoria bounded into the reading room showcasing in her small hands a golden certifcate from school.""Best reader,"" it glistened. A smile came across my face as I looked into the eyes of the petite 7-year old who just last year had been held back in frst grade because her reading was not up to par.

It was the same smile that had flled my face six months prior, when victoria joined the reading program and I saw the other volunteers instantly point at me. Our supervisor had agreed with them, knowing I would use my patient disposition and friendly way with children to motivate our new student. I had nodded vigorously, smiling, not only because I was proud of the confdence they had in me, but because nothing would make me happier than taking on the challenge of helping victoria improve her reading.

After spending the frst session responding to an unrelenting stream of questions, I recognized that victoria's talkative nature and impatience for answers overshadowed her desire to sit down and read. I treasured her energy and insatiable curiosity and fueled it with my own enthusiasm. Yet, for every interest she presented, I took her to scan the library shelves in search of a related book. I watched her eyes grow with excitement as I tirelessly helped her press through the stories, a journey in search of her answers. Some of the books I chose were diffcult for her, but we read through them together, challenging limits and quenching the thirst for knowledge. In books, I told her time and again, she would fnd all she wanted to know.

Taking her certifcate in my hands, I couldn't help but be proud that part of this glittering piece of paper was likely my doing.My thoughts were interrupted by victoria's chant. ""I got best reader!"" she exclaimed over and over jumping between feet as her arms waved from side to side. Without hesitation, I followed. Holding her certifcate up for all to see, I matched my footing with hers as we hopped the length of the room giggling.

Whether it is victory celebrations or talking in different voices, whenever I am with these kids, I fnd myself being pulled into their childhood world—a world of simplicity, of undying curiosity, and of pure innocence. It is a world in which if everything is not perfect, it defnitely can be. And with a simple ""prayer to god"" or ""kiss on the boo-boo"" it will be.

Though I go in each week to be these kids' teacher, I come out, having been their student. They have introduced me to a side of me I never realized existed.

As I enter college, it is not only my intelligence or my accumulated knowledge, but also the kid in me who will bring success. This child will jump to try every new activity with an enthusiasm that cannot fade. She will ask questions of everything she sees, of everything she hears and of everything she reads. She will dream big and for every step she stumbles upon towards that dream, she will get right back up and step again, this time, a little more carefully. And she will do all this, approach every life hurdle or triumph with a smile- a big contagious smile.www.cracksat.net

"THE COLD MId-AUGUST SAN FRANCISCO BAY fog was just beginning to roll in over Piedmont as I snapped the cover shut on Jennings Burch's book ""They Cage the Animals at night,"" the most recent addition to my ""get ready for 7th grade summer reading extravaganza."" It is a story about a young boy who lives in various orphanages and foster homes with only his stuffed animal, Doggie, for companionship. My cousin from Connecticut had told me that it was a fabulous book, but little did I know how it would touch my life and the lives of others.As I gazed across my room at the pile of stuffed animals I had been collecting since I was young, an idea came to me. I would collect stuffed animals for children like Jennings. First, I contacted local agencies that support children suffering from abuse and neglect and told them about my idea. They said that the stuffed animals would be very helpful in therapy and would certainly lift children's spirits.

I decided to call my project ""Cuddle Buddies."" now I actually had to come up with the ""buddies""! I wrote articles for the local and school newspapers, telling Jennings' story and asking for donations of stuffed animals. My phone rang off the hook; schools, families, local businesses and toy manufacturers all wanted to help. Much to my delight this project took the Bay Area by storm. By the second week my living room looked like a zoo with animals tucked in every corner and on top of each chair. Every time my mom and I made deliveries to the agencies, the kids would be waiting for their Cuddle Buddies with their eyes down, too shy to look but shaking with excitement.

Six years after its launch, Cuddle Buddies continues to expand. Each year I solicit from more toy companies and communities. now over 25,000 stuffed animals have been donated to agencies in the Bay Area and Connecticut, emergency units, two orphanages in Africa and one in germany. At the Saidia Children's Home in Kenya, Simon, a seven year old, whose parents died from AIDS, couldn't sleep at night. When the Cuddle Buddies were laid out for him to choose from, Simon selected a grey koala bear and soon after was sleeping through the night. My heart ached when I learned that a young girl in Oakland had stopped cutting herself so she could get the big black dog that she wanted so badly. I never dreamed that Cuddle Buddies would be used in these ways.

Knowing that I would be going on to college and that others my age could do what I have done, I decided to expand Cuddle Buddies. To spread the word beyond the Bay Area I designed a website, www.cuddlebuddies.net, and contacted newspapers and Tv stations across the nation. The response was overwhelming. I heard from kids, parents, agencies and even The girls Scouts. I am now helping to establish two dozen Cuddle Buddies chapters from Utah to north Carolina.This has been a great experience. I have learned how to follow through on an idea, how to champion a cause and how to deal with setbacks. But most importantly, I have learned how easy it is to positively impact a life and the joy that comes from it. I will go to college with these lessons in mind and hope to continue my work with Cuddle Buddies, even as I engage in a whole new set of exciting academic and nonacademic pursuits.www.cracksat.net

"""HELLo! WHAT'S YOUr NAME?"" ""PEN-YUAN HSING."" I see The Expression, then hear The response: ""What?""

I certainly did not realize what a big impact this arrangement would have on me.

Near the end of the first semester, I was approached by a girl from a neighboring school who attended this earth science course. She asked if I wanted to join her on an environmental survey of Taiwan's Keelung coast conducted by an organization called Taipei Wetnet. For a moment I hesitated, I literally had no experience in responding to invitations. What suddenly came out of my mouth surprised me, ""Sure, what time?""

For the next three years I spent in Taipei Wetnet, I gained not only a close friend, knowledge about the problems our environment faced, but perhaps most importantly found a group of people who shared the same convictions, who are passionate about the same thing, the plight of our precious planet. A year after being introduced to this organization, I was its coordinator and presented my frst academic paper at an environmental education conference. I learned that I don't always have to be the quiet one in the corner, that I do and can have things to share with everyone else. I don't have to fear.

I often think about how I managed to say yes on that fateful day. Was it just because of a pretty face? Or maybe there has always been a special part of me that wanted to get out, and she was instrumental in ""fipping the switch."" This eye-opening experience and what I learned from it is what I desperately want to share with the world.

Perhaps, somewhere out there is another quiet person in the corner just waiting to be found. A switch waiting to be fipped. You just have to fnd it, fip it, and make the world a brighter, warmer place.www.cracksat.net

"THE GREATEST JOY OF MUSIC IS to share it with others. Unfortunately, the pleasure of performing is often forgotten when players become more concerned with the technicalities and notes. I also once thought that I knew all the important keys to successful piano playing: practice, technique, dedication, and a love for what I do. Focused on the details, I lost sight of my audience.

During my sophomore year, my friend invited me to join ""Music from the Heart,"" a group that showcased its musical talents to senior citizens. Although I accepted the invitation to support her, I began to regret my choice as the frst performance approached. not knowing how the seniors would respond to my performance, especially when I made a mistake, performing before the seniors became a terrifying thought.

Although my frst performance went smoothly, it was hard to know whether the seniors enjoyed the pieces or the performance. While the group performed, the seniors would talk to each other, pausing to clap at the end of each piece. Trying to impress the audience, I eventually grew accustomed to preparing a showy piece as the monthly performance approached.

So used to this monthly routine, I doubted that this performance would be different from the previous ones when I was ready to perform my favorite piece one summer day. While waiting for my turn, I glanced around the room, noting with some uneasiness the growing number of seniors gathered around the piano. Amidst the crowd of chattering seniors, one woman's rapt attention to the performance caught my interest. She greeted each performer with a wide toothy smile and made a small comment about the composition. Uncertain of her expectations, I watched for her reaction when I rose to introduce my piece, ""Clair de Lune"" by Claude Debussy.

""Ooh, I love that song,"" was all she said in response.A smile crossed my face when I discovered that she shared my enthusiasm for the composition. To demonstrate to her how much I enjoyed the song, I played my best to convey what made this moonlight song so special to me. My minor concerns on technicalities slowly dissipated as the song progressed. All that mattered then was playing the song I loved as well as I could. For the frst time, I felt contented with my performance, undisturbed by mistakes.

The performance was far from perfect. However, none of the seniors commented that the rhythm was too slow or the notes were wrong like the audition judges would normally do. Although they still chattered softly during the performance, they all smiled and clapped. A few of them would say that the song was lovely. They appreciated my efforts to entertain them and eagerly asked the group to return soon. Just the delighted smile on the woman's face made the performance worthwhile.

It was the seniors' appreciation for what I did that brought them back to the piano each month, and my love for what I did that drew me to it. The monthly performance was not just a musical showcase; it was my chance to give back to the community and to help enrich the seniors' life. The true joy in my life is not just sharing music, but devoting myself to community services as a volunteer.www.cracksat.net

"I WISH I WAS INVISIBLE. I wish I was invisible. I wish I was invisible. One of my biggest fears has always been going to an unfamiliar place, but each time I have had the satisfaction of knowing that at the end of the day I can go home. I am a shy person, and it has always been diffcult for me to adjust to a new environment. Transitioning from eighth grade to high school was especially diffcult for me because my high school was, in fact, a boarding school, which meant that that feeling of satisfaction was no longer present at the end of the day but postponed to the end of the week. Living at LFA was a completely new world for me and nothing I had experienced could have prepared me for it.

With confused eyes and nothing less than a nauseous sensation in my stomach I entered my frst day of high school. growing up, I had always gone to school with people who looked like me, sounded like me, and dressed liked me, but here I quickly learned that I was the minority. I was not alone in this. Two of my friends came to LFA with me and, with this in mind, my shyness and I did not think it necessary to make new friends. Besides being one of the only schools with its own ice rink and providing only the latest technology for its students, it suddenly hit me that my new home had countless possibilities, but, before those possibilities could be realized, I had to take initiative. I learned a very important lesson at LFA: you will only get out of life as much as you put into it. Stepping out of my comfort zone allowed me to discover an interest and skill for volleyball and hidden leadership as the captain of the Jv team. I became a tutor and friend for young Hispanic students at the nuestro Center, and they reminded me how important it is to give back to the community. After numerous all nighters, I developed a system where I could get all of my homework done and still be able to get involved with sports and extracurriculars without having to sacrifce any sleep time.

Towards the end of my sophomore year a family member's sickness unfortunately forced me to leave my school and return home. I left LFA and joined my new family, Mirta ramirez Computer Science Charter High School. Containing a student body that was 99 percent Hispanic, I was no longer the minority. I had unconsciously become accustomed to the LFA way of life because, in my mind, this tiny mustard yellow building with no more than four windows could not possibly compare to my old home. I was right. no, my new home was not as big nor as fancy, but I discovered that was not a setback. Although the resources were not directly visible nor as easily accessible, I learned that obstacles did not exist for students there. Most, if not all, of the students had the same hunger for knowledge as I had.

This summer my school announced that the building which we had been using had fre code violations and we could not return to our building in the fall. Throughout the summer my school did not have a building and did not fnd one until a few weeks after school started. By that time I had already taken a decision to, once again, leave my home and join yet another family. What I realized on my frst day at Josephinum Academy, was that my shyness had not tagged along and I was eager to go to school. The nauseous feeling had left my stomach and enthusiasm had entered. I had already gained and learned so much from the people I had met in my two previous schools that I could not wait to continue my journey and embark on yet another discovery.

The knowledge that I have gained from these three schools is something I will take with me far beyond college. My roommate, across-thehall mates, and classmates have infuenced my life as much as I hope to have impacted theirs. It is evident to me that they have helped me develop into the very much visible person I am today. I have learned to step outside of my comfort zone, and I have learned that diversity is so much more than the tint of our skin. My small mustard colored school taught me that opportunity and success only requires desire.I would be an asset to your college because as I continue on my journey to success, I will take advantage of every opportunity that is available to me and make sure to contribute as much as I can too. now I am visible. now I am visible. now I am visible, and I want to be seen.www.cracksat.net

Overall, this personal statement essay is a good start, but it lacks clarity and depth in some areas. The author does a decent job of expressing their feelings of shyness and difficulty adjusting to new environments. The essay shows the author's growth and development throughout their high school years, which is commendable. However, there are certain weaknesses that need to be addressed.

Strengths:
1. Honesty and Vulnerability: The author expresses their shyness and struggles with adjusting to new environments openly and honestly. This vulnerability allows the reader to connect with them on a personal level.
2. Growth and Progress: The essay shows the author's growth and progress in stepping out of their comfort zone, discovering their interests, and becoming a leader. This demonstrates their ability to adapt and overcome challenges.

Areas of Concern:
1. Lack of Structure: The essay lacks a clear structure and organization. It jumps from one thought to another without proper transitions or flow. It would benefit from a clearer introduction, body paragraphs that focus on specific experiences, and a solid conclusion.
2. Lack of Details: While the essay mentions various experiences, it lacks specific details and anecdotes to make them more vivid and engaging. Adding specific examples and anecdotes will make the essay more memorable and impactful.
3. Repetition: The author repeats certain phrases throughout the essay (""I wish I was invisible"", ""now I am visible""). While repetition can be effective for emphasis, it is overused in this essay, resulting in a lack of impact.

Concrete Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Revise the Introduction: The introduction should grab the reader's attention and provide a clear thesis statement. Consider starting with a specific anecdote or a captivating statement about the author's experiences with shyness and adjusting to new environments.
2. Develop Body Paragraphs: Each body paragraph should focus on a specific experience or lesson learned. Include specific details, anecdotes, and reflections to make the experiences come alive. Connect each paragraph to the overall theme of growth and development.
3. Remove Repetition: While the theme of visibility is important, repeating the same phrases throughout the essay diminishes their impact. Choose one or two instances to highlight this theme and focus on developing it with stronger examples and reflections.
4. Strengthen the Conclusion: The conclusion should summarize the main points of the essay and leave a lasting impression. Consider connecting the conclusion back to the introduction or expanding on the author's future goals and aspirations.

Overall, this personal statement essay has potential, but it needs significant revisions to enhance its impact and make it more compelling. With clearer structure, more specific examples, and thoughtful reflections, the essay can become a standout piece in the college application. Good luck!

"I BELIEVE IN PEOPLE. THIS CONVICTION drives my action and ambitions, and defnes me in a world of cynicism and doubt. I have seen the power of people and their ability to come together in times of need and joy and sorrow. I know that ultimately, humans strive for belonging and community; thus, while loneliness and anger may always be in existence, so will be togetherness and bliss. My strong faith in humanity stems from my witnessing of the best in human qualities while doing the MS150 and during Hurricane Ike, and pushes me to pursue a career in helping others. Both of these events have allowed me to see humanity at its best, performing selfess acts of benevolence.

For the past four years, I have participated in the BPMS150 bike tour from Houston to Austin. This 175 mile ride raises funds for the national MS Society, which sponsors medical research for multiple sclerosis and aids the families of its victims. I can say from experience, the ride is grueling; enormous hills, headwinds, fatigue, and body aches are prevalent throughout. Yet every year, over thirteen thousand riders decide to put their minds and bodies through two days of torture so that they can help those who live with it every day. I have raised, over four years, more than eight thousand dollars to beneft the MS Society, and have never regretted any of the painful training or the ride itself. The view at the starting line is one of the most empowering I have ever witnessed: thousands of people, all of them with their hands on their handle bars, one foot poised on a pedal. All are ready to experience exhaustion for the beneft of others, like my father. He was diagnosed with MS when I was four, and is a constant motivator for me. I witnessed him become blind in one eye, and struggle with a body that refuses to function normally. I participate in this ride every year for him, as do thirteen thousand others. The power of people will ultimately help my father to receive better medical treatment, and maybe even one day, be cured.

While writing this essay, I was also able to observe and be a part of amazing human efforts. Hurricane Ike devastated Southeastern Texas, particularly the Houston and galveston areas. Much of my extended family lives in galveston, and so was forced to evacuate. Without hesitation, my parents opened up our home to aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, and pets. This is the environment in which I have always lived; our home is anyone's shelter, our food is anyone's nourishment. Together, our entire family weathered the storm, and comforted one another. My aunt's home received electrical power prior to my home, and so she eagerly welcomed us to stay with her. Large scale displays of altruism could be seen in the hundreds of University of Houston students handing out food and water to those affected by the hurricane. During times of need, people band together for safety and solace. Community is instinctual; dismiss the notions of survival of the fttest. People truly desire closeness with one another.

In the future, I hope to pursue a career in public health. I love studying science and math, and I would like to use this passion to beneft large numbers of people. Many go without basic medical treatment, and this causes a huge discrepancy in quality of life and health in the population. Even if this problem can never completely be solved, I want to help remedy this as much as possible. With small deeds and cooperative effort, humans can accomplish immense good. I know this because I believe in people, and I have seen them at their fnest.www.cracksat.net

"JULY 22 LAST YEAR WAS MEANT to be a typical Sunday. Just like every Sunday, my mother and I were getting ready to visit my older brother at his Waikiki apartment, where we would talk for a little while. But July 22nd was different. That chilly morning, we got a phone call from his roommate telling us my brother was going to the emergency room. As we drove to Queen's Hospital, I didn't know what to think. Although I tried to assure myself that nothing serious could have happened to him, anxiety clouded my mind.

My brother, Tyson, emigrated from vietnam with my mom and my other older brother to the United States in 1990, with dreams of a new life and fresh opportunities. He enrolled in high school with virtually no knowledge of the English language. Even though he had to simultaneously manage a part-time job at McDonald's, he excelled in academics and was the top of his class in calculus.

At 34 years old, he was the epitome of health: he ran marathons every year, had a healthy diet, and never smoked or drank alcohol. When I got to the Er and saw him lying in the hospital bed, he looked like the Tyson that I always knew. nothing seemed wrong. He just seemed tired, and he didn't have the energy to speak.

However, coming back from an MrI scan, my brother seemed different. His eyes were unfocused and dazed, as if he didn't see the room in front of him. Uneasiness and fear rushed down my spine. I shouted for help, just as my brother's body started to spasm. I felt a profound emotion surging up in me, one that I had never experienced before--a wrenching sense of trepidation, laced with sickening adrenaline. The seizure took control of his body, and he began to foam at the mouth. His body seized up, but I was frozen still. I didn't know what to do. I felt useless and terrifed.

Tyson told me, when I was just a kid, not to work while I was in high school. I was young, though, and still wanted to work because I wanted to make money, like him. During his high school years, he took on a part-time job after school, even though it meant he had to come home late every night. Often, he would stay up through the early hours of the morning, determined to complete his schoolwork. He held down the job, despite its exhausting physical toll, because he had to: he had to assist with the bills and support my mom, so that she could take English classes at the local community college. Tyson said that I didn't have to work, because he would always be there to support me.

While my brother was in the hospital, my mother and I went there every day from before dawn to late at night, when the streets were empty. Tyson had developed severe brain infammation as a result of the seizure. He had dozens of tests done: X-rays, MrIs, blood tests, spinal taps, a bronchoscopy, and even a brain biopsy. A labyrinth of Iv tubes, wires, and cables were hooked up to his body, monitoring his life signs and feeding dozens of chemicals and solutions into his bloodstream. The doctors kept him constantly sedated. His brain infammation was life-threatening, and he caught a case of severe pneumonia. His doctors had to place him on life support. In three weeks, my brother had gone from being in the best shape of his life, from being a veritable Superman, to laying on his deathbed.

When I was a kid, I was a crybaby. I cried when I didn't get the toy I wanted. I cried when I didn't get the food I wanted. However, at some point during my childhood, around the age of six, I stopped crying. no matter how much I was teased or pushed around, I never cried. no matter how much I was mocked about my clothes, or my ethnicity, I didn't cry.August 11 last year was the frst time since childhood that I cried. It was the day that my brother passed away. And it was the frst time that I ever saw my mom cry. It was a traumatizing experience, and for a while I was depressed that such a tragedy could occur so arbitrarily to someone like my brother: someone who was strong, someone who was healthy, someone who lived by a strong moral code and never sacrifced his values for material rewards. But after a while, I realized that the circumstances of his death were not a refutation of his beliefs, but instead, a reminder of their importance. Even though we cannot control the twists and turns of life, we must deal with them as best we can. My brother, even though he didn't know English, enrolled in school and ultimately excelled. And at the same time, to help our mother go to school on the side, he took on a part-time job. Certainly he must have wished that he hadn't faced those disadvantages, but he didn't complain. rather, he faced the realities of his situation head-on, and succeeded. Tyson's death was a tragic refection of the cold, random chance of nature, but it was in no way any verdict on his philosophy: instead, I realized, it served as a clear reminder to me that the worst can happen to even the best, and that the strength of an individual lies in his ability to maintain his values when faced with such diffcult situations. Today, I still hold onto the lessons that my brother taught me through his actions: to put the needs of your family frst, to always persevere in the face of adversity, and to never compromise your ideals for petty desires. To lose heart in these values because of his death, then, would be a harsh disservice to Tyson's legacy.www.cracksat.net

"""IT APPEARS ALL YUUr CELLS ARE DEAD.""

Only shock prevented the tears from streaming down my face. My cells were dead. After being accepted into the competitive Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer research Program (SIMr), and spending approximately 170 hours of the past month manipulating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), I was back to square one—with only one month of my internship remaining. How in the world was I going to make up for lost time?

As I asked myself the question, I thought back to exactly how I had spent those 170 hours, working to develop the stem cells which now, under the microscope, were hollow with the absence of life.

I started my internship a little overwhelmed by the fancy hoods, automatic pipettes, and high-speed centrifuges. But by the frst of the 170 hours, I had familiarized myself with the equipment and begun my quest to fnd the function of PrDM1—a gene thought to control replication in hESCs. First though, I needed to make a growth medium for the hESCs. I painstakingly measured to the ten millionth of a liter, testing the accuracy of each measurement multiple times before fnally dispensing it into the medium solution. After I had plated the hESCs on my new medium, I waited with bated breath for the results.

To my joy, two days later, my cells were thriving and even outgrowing their new home. Known for their ability to quickly replicate, it was logical they would need to be frequently transferred. The diffcult part was that, as part of my experiment to fnd the purpose of PrDM1, I had different strains of hESCs (some serving as ""control"" strains) which could not be mixed. Transferring hESCs is a process requiring great concentration and coordination. It took me about three hours the frst time. By the end of the month, though, transferring was second nature and my cells were doing well—I had inserted a fuorescent protein into their DnA to verify the hESCs containing the resistant vector were living, as hypothesized. I had successfully created hundreds of stable hESC colonies of different strains. Everything seemed to be going so well . . .

But now was not the time to reminiscence. I snapped out of my daydream and refocused on the situation at hand.

""Ariela? I know taking the news the frst time can be hard, but keep in mind, you probably didn't do anything wrong. You know how sensitive they are . . . this sort of thing is common when working with stem cells.""

""I know,"" I said, smiling genuinely this time, ""I'm ready to try again.""

My project was not completed by the end of the summer, but through hard work, I was able to replicate parts of the experiment to produce valuable data. Although the experiment did not go as planned, I am proud of myself for persevering. As Thomas Edison said, ""Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.""www.cracksat.net

"HE'S IN MY ARMS, THE NEWEST addition to the family. I'm too overwhelmed. ""That's why I wanted you to go to Bishop Loughlin,"" she says, preparing baby bottles. ""But ma, I chose Tech because I wanted to be challenged."" ""Well, you're going to have to deal with it,"" she replies, adding, ""Your aunt watched you when she was in high school."" ""But ma, there are three of them. It's hard!""

returning home from a summer program that cemented intellectual and social independence to fnd a new baby was not exactly thrilling. Add him to the toddler and seven year old sister I have and there's no wonder why I sing songs from Blue's Clues and The Backyardigans instead of sane seventeen year old activities. It's never been simple; as a female and the oldest, I'm to signifcantly rear the children and clean up the shabby apartment before an ounce of pseudo freedom reaches my hands. If I can manage to get my toddler brother onto the city bus and take him home from day care without snot on my shoulder, and if I can manage to take off his coat and sneakers without demonic screaming for no apparent reason, then it's a good day. Only, waking up at three in the morning to work, the only free time I have, is not my cup of Starbucks.

We were already different at age fourteen. She gave birth to me and went to an alternative high school; I established closeness with new friends in a competitive high school. She and my then present father were taking care of me; I was studying the environmental effects on the onset of schizophrenia. She took her daughter to preschool, and I vowed to never let anything get in the way of my academics. Even though I'm taking courses that prepare me for a career in the medical feld, a path I would not pursue even at risk of spontaneous combustion of Earth, there is no excuse for me to fail. After all, my family has a reputation for failure, and if I don't push myself, no one else will. When I think of me not choosing the effortless Bishop Loughlin High School and traditional fun with friends and preferring the intense courses, dedication to achievement, and overall feeling of self-worth, I cannot believe my mother still can't accept my choice.

One thing I've learned growing up in Brooklyn is that disappointment happens often. The bike I rode to school in the morning wasn't there when I went to get it in the afternoon. That's Brooklyn. Instead of seeing movies with friends on weekends, I work hard and attempt to keep the little kids out of my mom's hair. That's Brooklyn. Instead of going outside to my backyard, I remember I don't have one, and settle for the 12' by 6' concrete space in front of my house. That's Brooklyn. My Brooklyn doesn't feature fowers of the freshest air or people who smile and say hi. Instead, there's what might have been Orbit gum on the foor among the other thousand wads, a pool of strangely colored vomit, and the monotonous working class boarding the subway to the job it will complain about when it returns home.

If there's anything that Brooklyn has taught me, it's ""just do it."" I owe it to myself to keep trying, not because I have to, but because I want to prove to myself that I can. I'll have to endure the requirements of helping to raise my siblings and other responsibilities. After the chaos and traffc and noise have settled, I know I've made the right choice, even if my mother hasn't. And it's all worth it.www.cracksat.net

"EVERY TIME I DRIVE INTO A client's driveway, there's always that moment. That moment where I must shed any doubt I have and become adamant. That moment where I realize that, people are depending on me, and I must do my best to help them. And that moment where, with tool bag to my side, I must prepare to face whatever problem is waiting for me in their house. This time is no different. As with the hundreds of other problems I've faced, I must remember that every problem has a solution, and I can find it.

When I am greeted by a middle-aged woman as I approach the house, my remaining doubts evaporate. Once I see the individual I am about to help I become saturated with resolve. However, all she will see from me is a smile as I ask her how she is. I then ask her what the problem is, and she leads me to her computer. She tells me that her computer is shutting down randomly, and then leaves as I begin to work.With a simple push of the power button, the process begins. Unfortunately, for this case, just as quickly as it starts—the computer shuts off. never discouraged, I dismantle it to look for obvious signs of damage. However, everything here appears normal: wires secure, circuits shining.

But there's another test that may work. Eyes focused on the inside of the computer, I turn it on again. I have only a moment before it succumbs to its ailment again. Additionally, each time it starts could be damaging, so I have to make this count. When the sound of electricity surging through the computer begins, I immediately notice a vital fan failing to twirl: the computer is simply overheating. With a quick pull of the power I anesthetize the computer and operate. Using a replacement and screwdriver from my bag, I give the computer a new fan. Then, I start the computer nervously, but it starts perfectly.My confdence and determination sweat off as accomplishment. I quickly look for the woman. She can tell I solved her problem as I walk towards her with a grin, and she smiles too.

This case is one of the hundreds I've solved over the past few years, all without a single failure to fnd a practical solution. I started my business because after seeing how grossly overcharged the community was by corporate technicians, I believed it would be a practical and great way for me to help the community and have a job. After fxing computers for my school for a year, school offcials quickly noticed and spread word of my work, allowing my business to spread like wildfre throughout the local communities. With determination (and some creativity) I've solved some very unordinary and strange problems. I'd like to use this same willpower to help people in even better ways. no matter how impossible the problems I encounter may seem I will always remember what I tell myself when I fx computers: every problem must have a solution, and I can fnd it.www.cracksat.net

"WHEN MY GRANDMOThER CAME TO VISIT five years ago, she brought me a 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. To most, this would not sound very exciting—it would be almost as bad as a shirt saying ""My grandparents went to India, and all they bought me was this stupid shirt."" My reaction to the puzzle was different. I cut open the cardboard box as soon as I could, and poured the pieces out onto my puzzleboard. I worked patiently on the puzzle for hours at a time, my excitement building as more and more of the picture was revealed. I cut down my sleep time until the image of a picturesque forest was complete. The puzzle overshadowed all else in my life, if only for that short period of time.

Working on puzzles has helped me gain focus, determination, and patience. I have learned to apply these qualities to every task I face, dealing with the outside world in the same fashion as I would a puzzle. My love for science stems largely from this; science requires the same logical and levelheaded approach that a puzzle does, and as evidenced by the many puzzles decorating my house, this is an approach which suits my skills and temperament. This intellectual stimulation, coupled with a desire to discover more about life's mysteries, compels me to pursue a career in scientifc research.

This summer, I worked in a cardiology laboratory at UCLA, looking at proteins associated with HDL to understand how atherosclerosis can be averted. After some experiments provided questionable results, I was given the task of confrming that the viruses we were working with had been packaged and identifed correctly. I spent weeks running DnA gels, looking for specifc genes in each virus, but my results were inconsistent. I was frustrated, but instead of giving up on my assignment, I was even more determined to fnd an explanation. I considered every aspect of the experiment, working backwards until I reached the source—the primers I had used to amplify the DnA were nonspecifc and ineffective, and thus useless in distinguishing the three genes of interest to us. Knowing this, I was able to alter my experiment accordingly, looking at protein content instead of DnA sequences. I fnally showed that two of the three viruses were correct; the third, however, needed to be repackaged. My work was crucial to the undergraduate student I was working with, because he was able to redesign his experiment to account for this third virus.

Working in a lab was an exhilarating experience for me. Even though I gave up lying on the beach to instead play with viruses and chemicals, the compulsion to understand these proteins inspired and motivated me. I am tremendously proud of the piece I contributed to the atherosclerosis puzzle: a small piece, but integral nonetheless. The sense of accomplishment I felt because of my work in the UCLA lab was much the same as that which I felt upon completing the 3,000 piece puzzle my grandmother gave me. This feeling is one I hope to experience throughout my life, because the atherosclerosis puzzle is most assuredly not the last such puzzle I will work on.www.cracksat.net

"MY REASONS For WANTING To BE a doctor are very similar to why most people choose their career path: I want to make things fairer. People such as social workers are out to help make the world a little less unjust. It's not necessarily injustice from other people that I want to fght as these people do, but injustice from other factors. Many people who are close to me have been struck down from their future in ways that it's impossible for them to recover. My aunt was a great artist and loving mother before she developed severe schizophrenia. She now locks herself in her house for weeks at a time and remains isolated from her family. My friend Eric, who was once in his school's varsity basketball league, cannot play his senior season because a car accident left him nearly paralyzed. Finally, my friend vince's depression has stripped him of his will to live, and despite attempts of over a dozen psychiatrists and medications he still spends most of his days aimlessly lying in bed. While I try very hard to cheer him up by talking to and entertaining him I am deeply concerned about his future. This trend is something that I'm seeing almost everywhere. More and more people are becoming depressed and hopeless, and I want to be able to put life and happiness back into them.

not only do I see these injustices in my life, when I'm volunteering at my local hospital my desire to help become even more emboldened by the people I meet. A new grandmother I met recently had her spine shattered when she fell from a ladder back onto a table. As I talked to her, I remembered how many times I've seen pictures of my grandmother lifting me and my cousins and caring for us, and became overcome with emotion. While I don't believe her ability to care for her grandchildren will be destroyed, I know that she won't have the same opportunities as other grandparents and the inequality of the situation makes me extremely upset. I want nothing more than to give back her ability to walk and lift her grandkids. I believe being a doctor can allow me to bring this closer.www.cracksat.net

"SINCE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED in science and technology, I subscribed to many research magazines, including Popular Scienceand Scientifc American. However, until 10th grade, I never had the opportunity to contribute to medical research—something that I had always wanted to do. Then, one day I read an article titled ""Print Me a Pancreas, Please"" in Popular Science, which described novel tissue engineering research involving modifcation of off-the-shelf inkjet printers to print out living cells in a ""bioink"" solution. Having read much about tissue engineering, I realized this ""organ printing"" approach could potentially address problems of traditional tissue engineering methods, such as the need to precisely place specifc cell types in 3D scaffolds. I was so excited that I came up with a few ideas of my own about advancing the printer capabilities. I was impelled to contact the researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and Clemson University (CU).

I corresponded with the professor at MUSC and visited his lab multiple times, but realized that the actual printers were kept at CU. Therefore, I contacted the researchers at CU, who did not reply to about 50 of my e-mails. not the one to give up easily, I called the Principal Investigator (PI) and expressed my eagerness to contribute to the research. After seeing my resumé and computer-aided designs (""roadmap to Organ Printing""), he invited me to meet him at his lab on October 18th, which conficted with my school's Homecoming dance. To my friends' bewilderment I made the ""unpopular"" decision to miss the dance. They could not understand why I preferred driving 26 hours to meet a researcher and miss all the fun at the once-a-year dance. To me, this was clearly the right choice. I was trading a great school experience to literally get my hands into cutting-edge medical research.

The PI was so impressed with my original CAD designs (""roadmap to Organ Printing"") and my resume that he invited me to research at his lab. Over Christmas and other school breaks, I learned many laboratory techniques, conducted novel research, and independently succeeded in ""printing"" the frst functional 3D branching tube of smooth muscle cells (a rudimentary blood vessel). This research helped me win many science competitions and honors, including 2nd Place in Medicine and Health at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair and become the Top Florida Presenter at the national Junior Science and Humanities Symposium. My computer-aided designs were published in Biomaterials Forum and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.

This remarkable experience inspired me to perform many additional research projects and I consider it a turning point in my life. It has increased my passion for research and my determination to be a physician and work on devices or pharmaceuticals that improve people's quality of life. I have also become more confdent in my research efforts and am able to contact any researcher to pursue a position in their laboratory. I have realized that there are many opportunities for students like myself to contribute to labs and brainstorm solutions for current problems.www.cracksat.net

"whILE hEALING pEopLE wILL BE mY main priority as a doctor, I don't want to only help individuals overcome disease after disease. For true change I must work on a much larger scale. I plan on being involved in research, and drawing ideas and information from my patients and sharing it with researchers to fnd answers about the ailments that plague the human mind. By being a voice from the front lines I hope that I can catalyze the development of treatments and cures. Additionally, I want to become an advocate for public health. If a government is doing something that is detrimental to the health of its citizens, someone needs to point it out, and fght for a better alternative. Unless I do this then the people I help will continue to get sick regardless of how much I help.

Still, my main task as a doctor is to help patients, and I want to help as many of them as I can. Seeing the reality of the health of the world is very important to me if I am going to properly improve it. I have been so fortunate to live in a place where medicine is so refned, and I am even more blessed to know that I have the chance to help spread this refnement. While issues such as world hunger are constantly being improved, doctors in other countries are scarce and locals are still being trained in ancient ways and often hurting their patents more than helping. I want to give back my blessings a hundred-fold and spread better medicine. First, I want to see the health of our world as I help it by joining Medecins Sans Frontieres as soon as I can. Only after I help things frst hand can I make a mature decision on how I should try to help the world as a whole. I feel the experiences that I get from my education and the experiences helping people across the world will give me a very strong ability to know how to help to the best of my abilities. Today I am already planning for this journey by teaching myself foreign languages. I hope that by the time I am ready to help people, knowing many languages will help me bond with my patients and truly make me a doctor without borders. I plan on fghting for health for as long as I can, and I want to help every person I can regardless of background, money or stigma.www.cracksat.net

"GrowING Up wITh SEpArATEd pArENTS hAS not been the easiest life, but it has been my life. When I was younger, I'd hate going out to eat with my dad and seeing a family of four happily enjoying a meal. If my mother and father ever went out together to a restaurant, it was with me, once a year for my birthday, and was usually interspersed with various disagreements.

It was when I was in frst grade that I began to realize that, although my parents had their differences and no longer loved each other, I was the one thing that united them. I had no basis to be envious of what I thought of as ""complete"" families.

Both my mother and father, wanting the best for me, recognized early on my love and fascination with all things scientifc. They worked to create opportunities for me to pursue my interest. My mother would read at bedtime, at my request, nature feld guides instead of nursery rhymes. The two of us often made long journeys at 3:00 A.M. to witness meteor showers in the clear skies of the mountains. She encouraged me to set up experiments around the house, which I happily did—measuring the growth of palm tree saplings and dissecting owl pellets to extract the mouse bones inside. An environmental scientist, my father could not wait to transfer all of his scientifc knowledge into my young head. needless to say, many of his spontaneous lectures were far above my grasp—I still vaguely remember a quantum physics talk he gave me when I was eight—but they inspired me to learn more on my own.My thirst for scientifc knowledge grew over the years, without limits in any one specifc area. Then, in January four years ago, my Aunt Diane died after a fve-year battle with breast cancer. It was during my aunt's illness that I realized I could use my natural love of science to beneft others facing similar challenges.

I have continually pushed myself closer to this goal by excelling in my AP science classes, studying biotechnology at UC Davis through the COSMOS program, and competing as a member of my school's Science Bowl Team. This past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the reijo Pera Lab at Stanford University through the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer research Program. During this two-month internship, I worked with human embryonic stem cells to explore the function of PrDM1, a potentially-useful gene in the creation of regenerative medicines.

The scientifc spark my parents recognized years ago has shaped my life, and with it, I wish to shape the lives of others. I aspire to become a biomedical researcher, a career that harnesses my long-time fascination of science and my commitment to improve the quality of life for those facing medical challenges. It would be a privilege to work alongside scientists, exploring new treatments and technologies to create exciting new options for patients and their families.www.cracksat.net

"I TROD THE MUd IN THE misty spring rain. It was Qing Ming, the holiday in China when we honored our deceased ancestors. On the ground of the cemetery, drenched fowers lay in my grandfather's remembrance. That morning—a month before my sixth birthday—I clung tightly to my mother's sleeves and fnally learned why he passed away.

My grandfather had been a victim of cancer. Because the diagnosis came too late, all treatment was futile. As my mother whispered this to me with grief in her eyes, I stomped angrily in the mud. I blamed the doctors who couldn't fnd the tumor in time to save him. That rainy morning launched my dream to help cure cancer—a common wish, but one that fueled a life-changing pursuit. Knowing that the best protection against cancer was to detect it as early as possible, I examined the widely used methods of detection. I read about mammography and was astounded to learn that it failed to detect a large percentage of cases. As I wondered how to make detection more accurate, I heard about a research internship program at ____ Cancer Center. I jumped at the opportunity.

There, my mentors encouraged me to investigate cancer's genetic causes. I became intrigued by a gene suspected to play a role in the onset of breast cancer. We examined a process of gene-silencing—known as methylation—that changed DnA structure while keeping the sequence itself intact. Through a series of assays, we pinpointed the methylated sites in the gene sequence that distinguished cancerous breast cells from healthy cells. These were markers of disease!The thrill came from knowing the vast clinical applications of the discovery. Finding such markers is a step toward the individualization of cancer treatment. genomics-based diagnostics would detect cancer earlier than traditional procedures. Also, since methylation does not change the DnA sequence, it is reversible. Therapeutics could target these sites and minimize harm to healthy tissue.

Personalized cancer diagnostics promise a new dawn, but they are not yet reality. Many more genes need to be studied before we can fully comprehend the roots of the disease. Awed by the complexity of cancer, I realized that my dream was much more intricate than I imagined. However, my youthful passion in medicine did not dwindle. Instead, it strengthened and matured into a strategy. As my vague goals shaped into specifc inquiries, my curiosity became insatiable. The joy of uncovering the unknown affrmed my love for science. My generation will keep pushing the boundaries of knowledge, and nothing would give me more fulfllment than continuing to fght in the war on cancer.I recall that rainy Qing Ming morning when I gazed at my grandfather's gravesite. I wish I could tell him about the adventure he inspired. This war will be arduous, but every little ""eureka!"" along the way is a portent of victory.www.cracksat.net

"THIS PAST SUMMER I HAD THE opportunity to participate in a highly rigorous academic program at MIT called MITES, Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science. For six and a half weeks I lived with 68 other rising seniors and college undergrads. Though we were all warned about how hard the program would be, we were all at the top of our classes and refused to believe it- after all, who did they think we were? The frst day we sat together in a small auditorium, unaware of each other and of what lay ahead. We were told that our confdence would be shattered, our minds blown away, and our lives changed forever. Still somewhat unmoved, we were not afraid.

By the second week of MITES valedictorians, nerds, bookworms, and techies alike were leaning on each other’s shoulders at two in the morning crying over problem sets they had imagined only in nightmares. It is a well known fact that hard times bring friends closer together, but I would have never expected for these strangers to become my best friends, my support system, or even my family. The 16 hours days I was accustomed to at home did not last long. I was getting an average of four hours of sleep per night, fnishing a book per week, zooming through subjects once foreign to me, and constructing a semiautonomous robot from drill motors all at the same time.

We were each enrolled in 5 classes, my schedule consisted of Introductory Physics, Engineering Design, Chemistry, frst year Calculus, and Humanities. In the month and a half we completed a semester of Physics and Chemistry each, a full year of Calculus, the material equivalent to a semester in AP literature, and introductory level engineering. The work was so intense that when I entered school in the fall I enrolled in second year Calculus, and maintained the only A in AP Physics, having no physics experience prior to MITES.

Since this program I have not been satisfed with the regular coursework given at my school. I am constantly on the lookout for new programs to enroll in and other teams, clubs, and groups to join. This academic school year marks the peak of my involvement in educa-tional opportunities. I have somehow managed to fnd time for the Speech and Debate team, ACE mentoring team, swim team, Science Bowl team, California Honors Society and Scholarship Federation, Play Production, Jewish Student Union, gEAr-UP Mentoring Program, and folklorico dancing.

MITES was the most challenging experience of my life. The program is the single most pivotal point in my academic endeavors to date. The assistants we had had all gone through the program and agreed that even in college at Harvard, MIT, Caltech, and Princeton, nothing came close. The motivation and encouragement I gained from MITES has fueled my academic pursuits and pushed me to raise the bar.www.cracksat.net

"THIS SUMMER, I WENT TO THE governor’s Honors Program, also known as gHP, a six-week intensive college-like experience where the best and brightest students in georgia gather to learn and grow as individuals. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me. That is something of a hackneyed phrase; people cheapen the extremes of language by constantly using superlatives for everyday occurrences, making it harder and harder to actually describe the few subtle and transcendent moments of life. In Madame Bovary, Flaubert claims that language is but a cracked kettle on which we play music for the bears to dance, while we dream of making the stars weep. The experiences we have never ft within the too-close confnes of language; but I will try anyway. The classes that I attended were nothing like the classes that I would take normally. nowhere else would the teachers encourage sixteen and seventeen year-olds to look for sexual imagery in Shakespeare, and then fnd even more than they did, without the exercise being sordid instead of literary. I attended classes named anything from Dirty Words: Clean Thoughts (a class on Profanity; the only course in which the use of profane or vulgar language was prohibited) to Teenage Female Angst: Beyond Holden Caulfeld to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. All of them opened my mind to a brand-new way of looking at the world, and processing information. Thanks to the varying education that I received, I know that valuable information about life is not only in the “classics,” but even appears in seemingly mindless and trashy zombie flms.

While I learned a lot in the classrooms of GHP, I feel that most of my growth occurred outside of the classroom. I met the sort of people who will change the world, who will go forth into the world and, without making a big name, will do the things that make the world a better place. My best friends there were people that I would never have met; people I would never have known existed; people that I can now not imagine life without. One was a math major, an excellent athlete in every sport, and an accomplished singer; the running joke was that the only thing that he was bad at was failing. The other was a phenomenal writer, always ready to play an endearing trick on somebody, and the former’s girl-friend. Both of them were fairly conservative Christians, and yet totally accepting of me for whom I was, despite any of my clashes with their beliefs. I did not limit myself though, and made it almost a mission to fnd and talk to as many of the people there, because I was sure that each and every one of them would have an interesting perspective on things. Once I was walking back from playing Frisbee, and was stopped to discuss what the ethical framework for life ought to be; just for fun. The experience that I had there has undeniably changed me forever.www.cracksat.net

"THE ALARM CLOCK IS, TO MANY high school students, a wailing monstrosity whose purpose is to torture all who are sleep-deprived. Those who believe this are misguided, and are simply viewing the situation from a twisted perspective. For when these imprudent early-risers blearily rub their eyes each morning, and search in vain for whatever is making that earsplitting noise, they are, without a doubt, annoyed. Why?

It isn’t because the only thing they desire is to sleep a few extra hours, as many would presume. no, these kids are groggy and irritable because they are waking up to what they think will be another horribly boring day of school. If one of these foolish Sallys or Joes were, say, sleeping comfortably on a Saturday morning, I could certainly see something different happening. A beautiful breakfast of tantalizing vittles—eggs, hash browns, and the like—would be ready and waiting for them on their kitchen tables. But the scrumptious delight to outshine them all would be a slab of bacon, piled proudly for the taking. It would be that wafting, wondrous bacon smell that would draw dear, sweet Sally abruptly from her slumber—long before an alarm clock has the chance to pierce the air.

Oh, bacon: what a marvelous, glorious thing! I live for those heartstoppingly good strips of succulence, so crispy and crunchy, so packed with perfection. The thought of having a plate of bacon every day, perhaps every school day, sends me into sheer waves of ecstasy!To be sure, many others would also wax poetic about this lovely breakfast food. But precious few would share this same zeal for learning. I, however, can smugly decree that I do regard both very highly. I brightly waken every morning to the mellifuous joy that sounds from my alarm clock, a huge smile plastered on my face, and the yearning to learn in my heart.

When I board my school bus Monday through Friday, it is still pitch black outside. Busmates will groan about how even the day has not yet dragged itself out of bed; I only chuckle through their thirty-minute rant fest as we chug down the freeway. Opting to be part of a faraway Magnet school, after all, has its benefts. My peers may still not look forward to waking up earlier, but when we are all together in a classroom, we take on the “bacon mentality.” I have the opportunity to choose from a wealth of diverse classes, and love arriving to school each day with the prospect of having a new Spanish History lesson—taught to me in Spanish, for a change. Teachers, driven by the enthusiasm of their Magnet students, are inspired to create new classes for advanced students, including those who have completed AP Spanish Literature and are still eager to learn more, or those who want to learn about a specifc aspect of a subject—we now have a Middle Eastern History class. not to be outdone, the post-AP exam period of my English Language class included an intensive literature study, where we laughed at good ol’ Yossarian in Catch-22, and developed a strong attachment to Jay gatsby. I’d like to think that The Great Gatsby’s pursuit of Daisy is not unlike my own pursuit of bacon. I’ve gobbled up new knowledge rapidly, hankering after it like any elusive bacon strip, and happily digesting any new bits of information.

But six classes a year are simply not enough to satisfy my hunger for knowledge. Just as I eat bacon all three meals of the day (when possible), I attempt to learn all days of the week. rather than make another trip to some lackluster movie theatre on the weekend, I dedicate my time to reading another good book, or reviewing Economics with my friends. But high school is starting to smell like leftovers to me now; I want fresh, new, crisp learning. I want not to read a textbook written by a renowned professor: I want to hear him speak directly. I’m ready for the university, and hunger for all the new opportunities waiting for me! I’ve fnished my breakfast, and now it’s time to get going to school.www.cracksat.net

"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A MATh-SCIENCE girl. I sighed and sulked through classes on US History and French in eager anticipation of the formulas and applications I would be learning later in the day. I believe there are many factors which attribute to my success, two being my fascination and persistence.

When I was seven I once asked what math was good for and why I should learn it. The answer I received simply does not do math justice, “One day when you’re in line at the grocery store the cashier will give you too little change and you’ll be glad you learned this.” now in calculus I see the application of all these once foreign symbols, formulas, and letters. I am often amazed by the calculations I am able to do using the cumulative information acquired from nearly 12 years of education, such as how to maximize the volume of a box given a certain surface area. Math is not just plug and chug as many view it but it requires creativity and thinking out of the box to solve the problems encountered in the real world. Beauty lies in its simplicity and in the fact that proofs and observations are what brought the golden rectangle from ancient greece, Pascal’s triangle, and the Pythagorean Theorem as well as a host of other theorems, equations, and postulates. Math has made the impossible possible and the once long and tedious, simple and quick. The genius of it is amazing as well as the fact that any person is capable of applying and discovering it. I draw graphs and try to make shapes from functions for fun, count to 10 to calm down, and save money at the store, too. For all of these reasons and many more, I am fascinated by math.

I wasn’t always good at math, contrary to what students in my classes might say. When I frst showed interest in math in the 5th grade my parents laughed; middle school was even worse. Incoming 6th graders were given a test on the second day of school and depending on their scores were placed into a high or low speed math class. I was put in the slow speed math and missed a lot of class my frst year, as a result my grade drifted from a B to a C to a C-, then I got help. I knew I liked math and I didn’t want to do bad in it so I bought books and hired my older brother to help me. I eventually made it to a B+. Later, in the summer after my junior year, I took a course that covered nearly a year of Calculus. I was told that if I decided to take Calculus AB, I would be bored, so I went for a challenge. My strongest subject began to take up most of my time. I had to read review books, go online for help, and stay in during nutrition and lunch for extra instruction. It was hard, but my dedication paid off and I earned an A. This persistence and drive also help me excel in math.www.cracksat.net

"WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD, I fell in love. It was not a transient love-one that stayed by my side during the good times and vanished during the bad-but rather a love so deep that few would understand. It was not the love for a person, but the love for a language. It was the love for Spanish.

Having been born and raised behind the Iron Curtain, in a country where Western infuence was limited and the offcial and only language was romanian, I was on my own. Everyone around me, especially my family, had trouble understanding what could possibly draw me to such a foreign and, in their opinion, unattractive language. But as they say, love is blind, and the truth of the matter is that I wasn’t even sure what it was exactly that made Spanish so fascinating to me. The only thing I knew was that I absolutely adored hearing its perfectly articulated phrases, and trying to make sense of its sweet and tender words: serenades to my innocent ear.

Spanish entered through my door on June 16th, 1994, when a man from the local cable company came to connect our living room to the rest of the world. That day, I was introduced to “Acasa,” a romanian cable network dedicated to broadcasting Spanish language telenovelas (soap operas) to romanian audiences. As I learned to read, I started associating the romanian subtitles with the Spanish dialogue, and little by little, I began understanding the language. For a little girl who had yet to discover new aspects of her own language, this was quite an accomplishment, but no one around me felt the same way. My father, enraged at my apparent “obsession” with the language, scolded me incessantly, declaring that:

“We are immigrating to the United States, not to Mexico! You should spend your time learning English instead of watching that nonsense!”Sadly, my family’s objection was only the frst of many hardships I was bound to encounter. When I was nine, my immigration to the US forced me to say goodbye to what had become a huge and indispensible part of me. I needed to hear Spanish, to listen to it daily, and although Los Angeles could be considered a Spanish speaker’s paradise, my largely romanian neighborhood allowed for little interaction with the language. For six years, destiny kept us apart and the feelings that Spanish had evoked in me soon faded away.

But high school brought about a new era in my life, an era in which my love for Spanish was revived and greatly amplifed. For an hour a day, life was put on hold and I was able to speak and read Spanish more actively than ever. After two years of Advanced Placement Spanish, I not only understood the language to perfection, but spoke it fawlessly as well.

There are no words that can describe how proud and greatly accomplished I feel today at my ability to speak Spanish. During a recent trip to Mexico, I was mistaken more than once for one of the natives. One man, after seeing my romanian last name, asked me if it was my husband’s, for undoubtedly, he believed, I was Mexican. given to a romanian girl, whose family members were oblivious to the language, and who had learned it on her own despite their objections, this was the greatest compliment of all. In the United States, Spanish is the second most spoken language and a great asset for anyone who speaks it. It is not “nonsense,” as my father had dubbed it, and being able to prove this to him has made me even prouder for loving Spanish.My love of Spanish has infuenced much of who I am today. The fght that I led against family objections and immigration to a new land has allowed me to develop an ambitious and aggressive spirit in the face of adversity.www.liuxue.la It has made me stronger, and taught me that I must always fght with unstoppable perseverance for all that is important to me. I am determined to use my love and passion for Spanish to make an impact on the world. Currently, Spanish is the primary language of 21 nations around the globe, and one of the six offcial languages of the Un. I want to be the link that connects these nations to the United States, and to the 40 million Americans whose native language is Spanish. I want to use my ability to speak Spanish to learn more about the people of these nations, both on a professional and personal level. no matter where the path of life takes me, I wish for Spanish to always be a part of me.

Through the years, Spanish has evolved into one of my most remarkable accomplishments. Today, I am prouder than ever of loving Spanish-of having something that distinguishes me from the rest, something that makes me unique. It is not often the case for a romanianAmerican girl living in Los Angeles to exhibit such passion and devotion towards a language that is foreign to both her native and adoptive countries. nevertheless, Spanish is a big part of whom I am today, and an even bigger part of who I will be in the future.www.cracksat.net

The opening paragraph is attention-grabbing and sets the stage for the rest of the essay. However, there are a few areas where the essay could be improved to make it more compelling and memorable for admissions officers.

Strengths:
- The essay effectively demonstrates the writer's passion for Spanish and their determination to learn the language.
- The personal anecdotes, such as the introduction of cable television and the trip to Mexico, add a personal touch and make the essay more relatable.
- The essay shows growth and development, as the writer explains how their love for Spanish was revived in high school and how they have become proficient in the language.
- The conclusion effectively ties the writer's love for Spanish to their future aspirations and goals.

Areas of concern:
- The essay lacks specific examples and details to support the writer's claims. For example, the writer mentions being mistaken for a native in Mexico, but doesn't provide any specific incidents or experiences to illustrate this.
- The essay could benefit from more reflection and analysis. The writer briefly mentions the impact of their love for Spanish on their spirit and determination, but could go into more depth and provide more specific examples.
- The essay jumps around a bit chronologically, which can make it difficult to follow. It would be helpful to present the events and experiences in a more linear fashion to make the essay flow better.

Concrete suggestions for improvement:
- Include specific examples and anecdotes to support the writer's claims. For instance, instead of just mentioning being mistaken for a native in Mexico, the writer could describe a particular encounter or conversation that demonstrates their fluency in Spanish.
- Reflect more on the impact of loving Spanish on the writer's life. How has it shaped their worldview, their relationships with others, or their approach to challenges? Providing concrete examples and personal reflections will make the essay more engaging and memorable.
- Rearrange the essay to present the events and experiences in a more logical order. This will make it easier for the reader to follow and understand the writer's journey with Spanish.
